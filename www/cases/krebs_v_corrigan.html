<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">v.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Donald T. CORRIGAN and Dennis L.
Bronson, Appellees.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">No. 7790.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Argued April 22, 1974.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Decided June 25, 1974.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">YEAGLEY, Associate Judge:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is an appeal from a directed
verdict entered in favor of appellees (defendants) at the conclusion
of appellant's (plaintiff's) case in chief. The complaint alleged
that defendant Bronson negligently caused damage to personal property
belonging to plaintiff and that defendant Donald Corrigan was liable
for such damage as Bronson's principal.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The evidence reflected the following.
Plaintiff is an artist who creates plexiglass sculptures. On the
morning of the accident he entered his studio to find a station wagon
parked within, just inside of a 10 roll-back garage door. The bumper
was very close to a large sculpture. The car had been placed there by
defendant Bronson so that he could avoid the chill of the morning
while endeavoring to fix some dents in the automobile. Although
plaintiff had not given Bronson permission to put the car in the
studio, he did not order him to remove the car at once. However,
after giving Bronson a dent-removing tool, so as to expedite his
work, and instructing him on the use of the took, he asked him to
remove the car as soon as possible. At that moment the telephone
(which was on a nearby wall) rang and plaintiff proceeded to answer
it. From that position he could see the studio area, but his
attention was away from Bronson as he talked on the telephone. While
still on the phone, plaintiff glanced back toward where Bronson was
working and saw him &lsquo;flying through the air . . . at least
three feet off the ground-and he landed in the middle of (a
plexiglass sculpture).&rsquo; Four sculptures in all were destroyed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon the conclusion of plaintiff's
case, defendants moved for a directed verdict on the ground that
plaintiff had not presented a prima facie case of negligence. After
extended argument, mainly involving the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur, the court granted defendants' motion and directed a verdict
in their favor. The judge, in explaining his decision to the jury,
indicated that a verdict was directed because plaintiff could not
show what caused defendant Bronson's body to fall or be thrown onto
the sculptures.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This information was not only unknown
to plaintiff but was peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant
Bronson. He, of course, never testified as to any explanation he
might have had for the accident, since his motion for a directed
verdict was granted. We do not believe a plaintiff ought to be held
to that burden on these facts which, left unexplained, support, an
inference of negligence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new
trial.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[1][2] It is well established, to the
extent that a citation of authority is unnecessary, that the mere
happening of an accident does not give rise to any inference of
negligence. On the other hand, it is established that the
circumstances of certain accidents may be such as to justify an
inference that negligence was involved. In the District of Columbia
an inference that defendant may have been negligent is permitted when
the following three conditions exist: first, the cause of the
accident is known; second, the accident-producing instrumentality is
under the exclusive control of the defendant; and third, the
instrumentality is unlikely to do harm without negligence on the part
of the person in control. Powers v. Coates, D.C.App., 203 A.2d 425
(1964), citing Washington Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Hickey, 78
U.S.App.D.C. 59, 61, 137 F.2d 677, 679 (1943). The presence of these
factors distinguishes such cases from the vast majority that lack
those features, concerning which it is said that negligence is not to
be inferred from the mere happening of an accident.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[3] In the case before us there is no
doubt that the cause of the accident was known, i.e., the sculpture
was damaged by Bronson's falling on it. To say that the cause of the
accident was not known, because there was no evidence as to what
caused Bronson to come into contact with the sculptures, &lsquo;confuses
the cause of the accident with the manner in which it was caused,
lack of knowledge of which, in plaintiff, is a reason for the
dectrine of res ipsa loquitur. . . .&rsquo; Kerlin v. Washington Gas
Light Co., 110 F.Supp. 487, 488 (D.D.C1953) aff'd, 94 U.S.App.D.C.
39, 211 F.2d 649 (1954). The doctrine was applied in that case where
the evidence reflected that plaintiff, while standing on the sidewalk
was struck by an object propelled from an area where defendant's
employees were digging with picks.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[4] Nor is there any doubt that the
accident-producing instrumentality, Bronson's body, was within his
exclusive control. While falling cans in a supermarket may not be
within the owner's exclusive control,[FN1] we think it to be a fair
presumption that a person's body usually is within his exclusive
control; such is the sub silentio presumption in most medical
malpractice cases. See also Kohner v. Capital Traction Co., 22
App.D.C. 181 (1903). Defendants' contention that the dent-removing
tool was the accident-producing instrumentality, and that Bronson did
not have exclusive control over that tool, misses the mark. Moreover,
the factual assumption, being without proof of this record, is no
more than speculation. As stated, supra, the accident-producing
instrumentality was Bronson's body, the dent-removing tool, if at all
involved in this case, was in the control of defendant and would only
be related to the &lsquo;manner in which (the accident) was caused.&rsquo;
Kerlin, supra.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FN1. Jones v. Safeway Stores, Inc.,
D.C.App., 314 A.2d 459 (1974).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[5] Lastly, as in other situations
permitting the application of res ipsa loquitur, we consider it of no
small significance that the accident-producing instrumentality,
Bronson's body, is one which is unlikely to do harm in the absence of
negligence on the part of the person in control. Such a conclusion
does not ignore the possibility of other explanations for the
incident, explanations which might not involve negligence; but human
bodies do not generally go crashing into breakable personal property.
When they do, as here, we think the facts require the court of permit
an inference of negligence. The person in control of the body or
instrumentality may come forth with an explanation. To have to
explain the actions of one's body is certainly not unreasonable and
is less burdensome than to have to explain why a barrel of flour fell
out of one's warehouse onto a pedestrian, a situation to which res
ipsa loquitur was held applicable in Byrne v. Boadle, 159 Eng.Rep.
299 (Ex. 1863).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The instant situation, plaintiff's are
objects being damaged by an inexplicably falling human body, is not
unlike that of a parked automobile inexplicably being hit by a moving
automobile.In the latter situation a prima facie case of negligence
was found to have been presented, though there was no evidence as to
why defendant's car struck plaintiff's car. Bonbrest v. Lewis,
D.C.Mun.App., 54 A.2d 751, 752 (1947); Schwartzbach v. Thompson,
D.C.Mun.App., 33 A.2d 624 (1943).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a case which did involve a bodily
collision, Kohner v. Capital Traction Co., supra, plaintiff
established only that as he was riding on an open summer streetcar he
was injured by &lsquo;the violent contact of the right hand of the
conductor of the car with the face of the appellant . . ..&rsquo; Id.
at 182 of 22 App.D.C. Plaintiff was unable to testify as to any
negligent act on the conductor's part or as to the manner in which
the accident was caused. The court reversed a directed verdict for
defendant finding that res ipsa loquitur was applicable.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Machanic v. Storey, 115 U.S.App.D.C.
87, 317 F.2d 151 (1963), res ipsa loquitur was applied where a car
driven by defendant, in which plaintiff was a sleeping passenger,
went off the road causing injuries to plaintiff, although plaintiff
was unable to produce any evidence as to why the car left the road.
[FN2]</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FN2. Although the accident occurred in
Pennsylvania, the court applied the law of the District of Columbia
with respect to res ipsa loquitur.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[6] Appellees contend that res ipsa
loquitur does not apply when the accident-producing instrumentality
is a human body.We find nothing in the law of this jurisdiction to
indicate that res ipsa loquitur does not apply when the
accident-producing instrumentality is a body rather than an inanimate
object.In Kohner, supra, the instrumentality was a streetcar
conductor's hand.Medical malpractice cases also involve bodily
instrumentalities and it has been held that in a proper case res ipsa
loquitur may be applied. Raza v. Sullivan, 139 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 432
F.2d 617 (1970). cert. denied, 400 U.S. 992, 91 S.Ct. 458, 27 L.Ed.2d
440 (1971); Smith v. Reitman, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 352, 389 F.2d 303
(1967).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[7] Appellees also contend that
appellant could not rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because
there was an eyewitness to the accident, i.e., defendant Bronson, and
that appellant should have called Bronson as a witness before being
allowed to invoke res ipsa loquitur.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">[8] To our knowledge this court has
never held that a plaintiff may not invoke the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur when the defendant is an eyewitness. In fact on many
occasions[FN3] we have noted that one of the main reasons for the
doctrine is the superior, if not exclusive, knowledge which
defendants sometimes have as to the cause of accidents. If requiring
a plaintiff to call the defendant as an adverse witness was deemed a
sufficient method of determining the cause of an accident, there
would be no need for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The doctrine
exists because of the realization that examination of a defendant as
an adverse witness is not a viable way to discover the cause of an
accident.[FN4]</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FN3. E. g., Washington Sheraton Corp.
v. Keeter, D.C.App., 239 A.2d 620, 622 (1968); Powers v. Coates,
supra.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">FN4. In accord is J. &amp; Jay, Inc. v.
E. Perry Iron &amp; Metal Co., 161 Me. 229, 210 A.2d 462 (1965).
Language in Mercure v. Popig, 326 Mich. 140, 40 N.W.2d 95 (1949),
might seem to be to the contrary but the facts there (6-year-old
child hit by auto; child crossing street in mid-block) are not such
as would justify any inference of negligence and lacking evidence of
negligence, a directed verdict was properly granted.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">New Jersey and Missouri have held that
a plaintiff is not precluded from invoking resipsa loquitur because
he has not attempted to obtain evidence through discovery procedures.
Menth v. Breeze Corp., 4 N.J. 428, 73 A.2d 183 (1950); Bone v.
General Motors Corp., 322 S.W.2d 916 (Mo.1959).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Although there are no cases in this
jurisdiction commenting on whether a plaintiff must call an
eyewitness-defendant to testify before being allowed to rely on res
ipsa loquitur, there have been several where res ipsa loquitur has
been applied although an available eyewitness-defendant was not
called by plaintiff.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Machanic v. Storey, supra, res ipsa
loquitur was applied although the eyewitness-defendant (the driver of
the automobile which crashed) was not called by the plaintiff, who
himself was unable to testify as to the manner in which the accident
was caused.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Bonbrest v. Lewis, supra, the court
found plaintiff's evidence, that defendant's car hit plaintiff's
parked car, sufficient to establish a prima facie case of negligence,
although plaintiff did not call the eyewitness-defendant to testify.
While the court phrased its opinion in terms of the establishment of
a &lsquo;prima facie case&rsquo;, rather than specifically using the
term res ipsa loquitur, the effect is the same; plaintiff was allowed
an inference of negligence although the eyewitness-defendant was not
called as a witness.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Finally in Raza v. Sullivan, supra, res
ipsa loquitur was found applicable though the facts indicated that
the defendant-dentist was an eyewitness (he was the person who
treated plaintiff) and that he was not called by plaintiff as a
witness.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In deciding whether or not res ipsa
loquitur is applicable, courts necessarily are mindful of the
different effects which that decision will have on the parties and
the trial. If res ipsa loquitur is not employed, plaintiff's case is
terminated even though he suffered an injury that was caused by the
defendant. If res ipsa loquitur is found applicable, defendant is put
to no greater burden than to produce information peculiarly within
his knowledge as to how the incident occurred. Even if that
explanation is unsatisfactory or indeed even if no explanation is
made, the jury is free to decline to draw an inference of negligence,
and it is so instructed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We find that the plaintiff's evidence,
considered in the light most favorable to him, as must be done in
ruling on the motion for a directed verdict by a defendant, was
sufficient to raise an inference of negligence so as to survive the
defendants' motion and to put them to their proof.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
