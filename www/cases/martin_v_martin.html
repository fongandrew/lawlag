<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>Martin v. Martin</I>, 878 S.W.2d 30
(Ky. Ct. App. 1994).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">JOHNSTONE, JUDGE. Garis and Peggy
Martin appeal from a judgment of the Pike Circuit Court which
required them to pay rent to the cotenants of certain real estate.
Reluctantly, we reverse.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Garis and Peggy own an undivided
one-eighth interest in a tract of land in Pike County. This interest
was conveyed to Garis by his father, Charles Martin, in 1971.
Appellees, Charles and Mary Martin, own a life estate in the
undivided seven-eighths of the property for their joint lives, with
remainder to appellants.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1982, Charles Martin improved a
portion of the property and developed a four lot mobile home park
which he and Mary rented. In July of 1990, Garis and Peggy moved
their mobile home onto one of the lots. It is undisputed that Garis
and Peggy expended no funds for the improvement or maintenance of the
mobile home park, nor did they pay rent for the lot that they
occupied.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1990, Garis and Peggy filed an
action which sought an accounting of their claimed one-eighth portion
of the net rent received by Charles and Mary from the lots. The
accounting was granted, however, the judgment of the trial court
required appellants to pay &quot;reasonable rent&quot; for their
occupied lot. It is that portion of the judgment from which this
appeal arises.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The sole issue presented is whether one
cotenant is required to pay rent to another cotenant. Appellants
argue that absent an agreement between cotenants, one cotenant
occupying premises is not liable to pay rent to a co-owner. Appellees
respond that a cotenant is obligated to pay rent when that cotenant
occupies the jointly owned property to the exclusion of his co-owner.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Appellants and appellees own the
subject property as tenants in common. The primary characteristic of
a tenancy in common is unity of possession by two or more owners.
Each cotenant, regardless of the size of his fractional share of the
property, has a right to possess the whole.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The prevailing view is that an
occupying cotenant must account for outside rental income received
for use of the land, offset by credits for maintenance and other
appropriate expenses. See Barnes v. Kidwell, 245 Ky. 740, 54 S.W.2d
331 (1932). The trial judge correctly ordered an accounting and
recovery of rent in the case sub judice.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, the majority rule on the issue
of whether one cotenant owes rent to another is that a cotenant is
not liable to pay rent, or to account to other cotenants respecting
the reasonable value of the occupancy, absent an ouster or agreement
to pay. 51 A.L.R.2d 413 &sect; 8; see also Taylor v. Farmers and
Gardeners Market Association, 295 Ky. 126, 173 S.W.2d 803 (1943).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The trial court relied erroneously on
Smither v. Betts, Ky., 264 S.W.2d 255 (1954), for its conclusion that
appellants were &quot;obligated to pay seven-eighths of the
reasonable rental for the use of the lot they occupy.&quot; In
Smither, one cotenant had exclusive possession of jointly owned
property by virtue of a lease with a court-appointed receiver and
there was an agreement to pay rent. That clearly is not the case
before us. There was no lease or any other agreement between the
parties.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The appellees reason that the award of
rent was proper upon the premise that Garis and Mary ousted their
cotenants. While the proposition that a cotenant who has been ousted
or excluded from property held jointly is entitled to rent is a valid
one, we are convinced that such ouster must amount to exclusive
possession of the entire jointly held property. We find support for
this holding in Taylor, supra, in which the Court stated at 807-08:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">But, however this may be, running
throughout all the books will be found two essential elements which
must exist before the tenant sought to be charged is liable. These
are: (a) That the tenant sought to be charged and who is claimed to
be guilty of an ouster must assert exclusive claim to the property in
himself, thereby necessarily including a denial of any interest or
any right or title in the supposed ousted tenant; (b) he must give
notice to this effect to the ousted tenant, or his acts must be so
open and notorious, positive and assertive, as to place it beyond
doubt that he is claiming the entire interest in the property.
(Emphasis in original).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We conclude that appellants' occupancy
of one of the four lots did not amount to an ouster. To hold
otherwise is to repudiate the basic characteristic of a tenancy in
common that each cotenant shares a single right to possession of the
entire property and each has a separate claim to a fractional share.
4a Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property &sect; 601 (1986).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Accordingly, the judgment of the Pike
Circuit Court is reversed as to the award of rent to the appellees.</P>
