<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CHARLES BIGBEE, Plaintiff and
Appellant, v. PACIFIC TELEPHONE AND TELEGRAPH COMPANY et al.,
Defendants and Respondents</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">34 Cal. 3d 49 (1983)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Bird, J. This appeal questions the
correctness of a summary judgment entered in favor of four defendants
in this personal injury action. The determinative issue is whether,
under the evidence presented on the motion, foreseeability remains a
question of fact for the jury. (See Weirum v. RKO General, Inc.
(1975) 15 Cal.3d 40, 46 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36].)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">On November 2, 1974, plaintiff, Charles
Bigbee, was severely injured when an automobile driven by Leona North
Roberts struck the telephone booth in which he was standing.
Plaintiff thereafter brought an action for damages against Roberts
and the companies allegedly responsible for serving her alcoholic
beverages. A settlement was reached as to these defendants. In
addition, plaintiff sued the companies allegedly responsible for the
design, location, installation, and maintenance of the telephone
booth, including Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (Pacific
Telephone), the owner of the booth, Western Electric Company, Inc.
(Western Electric), Western Industrial Services, Inc. (Western
Industrial), and D.C. Decker Company (Decker).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plaintiff sought recovery against the
latter defendants 1 on theories of negligence and strict liability in
tort. A second amended complaint (hereafter, the complaint), filed in
1978, alleged in substance that on the night of the accident, at
approximately 12:20 a.m., plaintiff was standing in a public
telephone booth located in the parking lot of a liquor store on
Century Boulevard in Inglewood, California. Roberts, who was
intoxicated, was driving east along Century Boulevard. She lost
control of her car and veered off the street into the parking lot,
crashing into the booth in which plaintiff was standing.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plaintiff saw Roberts' car coming
toward him and realized that it would hit the telephone booth. He
attempted to flee but was unable to do so. According to the
allegations of the complaint, the telephone booth was so defective in
design and/or manufacture, or so negligently installed or maintained
that the door to the booth &quot;jammed and stuck, trapping&quot;
plaintiff inside. Had the door operated freely, he averred, he would
have been able to escape and would not have suffered injury.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Additionally, plaintiff alleged that
the telephone booth was negligently located in that it was placed too
close to Century Boulevard, where &quot;traffic . . . travelling
easterly, generally and habitually speeded in excess of the posted
speed limit,&quot; thereby creating an unreasonable risk of harm to
anyone who used the telephone booth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In September of 1978, Pacific Telephone
and Western Electric both demurred to the complaint on the grounds
that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action in negligence or in strict liability. The trial court
sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Plaintiff then sought review of this
ruling by petition for writ of mandate. (See generally, Coulter v.
Superior Court (1978) 21 Cal.3d 144, 148 [145 Cal.Rptr. 534, 577 P.2d
669].) The Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ 2 and, after
hearing, concluded that the complaint was sufficient to withstand a
general demurrer. ( Bigbee v. Superior Court (Bigbee I) (1979) 93
Cal.App.3d 451 [155 Cal.Rptr. 545, 17 A.L.R.4th 1298].) Accordingly,
the appellate court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the
trial court to vacate the judgment of dismissal and to overrule the
demurrers. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When the case was returned to the trial
court, all four defendants filed answers generally denying the
material allegations of the complaint. Discovery was conducted and on
July 29, 1980, defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment,
arguing that the undisputed facts demonstrated the absence of two
elements essential to plaintiff's case. (See Code Civ. Proc., &sect;
437c; Frazier, Dame, Doherty, Parrish &amp; Hanawalt v. Boccardo,
Blum, Lull, Niland, Teerlink &amp; Bell (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 331,
338, 339 [138 Cal.Rptr. 670].) (See fn. 3.) More specifically,
defendants argued that they had no duty to protect phone booth users
from the risk encountered by plaintiff -- a car veering off the
street and crashing into the phone booth -- since that risk was
unforeseeable as a matter of law. 3 For the same reason, they
maintained that Roberts' intervening negligent driving constituted a
&quot;superseding cause&quot; of plaintiff's injuries. (See fn. 4.)
Therefore, no act or omission of theirs could be found to be a
proximate cause of those injuries. 4</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In support of their motion, defendants
produced evidence which established, in substance, that the accident
occurred in the manner alleged in the complaint, and that plaintiff
could have escaped injury had the door to the phone booth not jammed.
In addition, several &quot;new facts&quot; were brought before the
court.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">First, the deposition testimony of
Michael Zellis supported plaintiff's assertion that he could have
escaped. Zellis was standing next to the phone booth occupied by
plaintiff just prior to the accident. He testified that he saw
Roberts' car veer toward the booth and that although he waited
several seconds before running away, he was able to get out of the
car's path and to avoid injury.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Second, the phone booth in which
plaintiff was standing when injured was one of two booths located in
the parking lot of the Fortune Liquor Store. The booths were situated
close to the front wall of the store, between the front door and the
sidewalk bordering Century Boulevard, near an entrance to the parking
lot. Plaintiff occupied the booth nearest the street, 15 feet to the
south of the curb line of Century Boulevard. 5</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Third, Century Boulevard is a six-lane
thoroughfare which runs east and west. For several blocks on either
side of the liquor store, it is straight and level. The posted speed
limit is 35 or 40 miles per hour.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Fourth, Roberts may have been speeding
when she lost control of her car. In the opinion of defendants'
expert witness, her car was traveling at a speed of 30 to 35 miles
per hour when it struck the phone booth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In opposition, plaintiff introduced
declarations which established that this accident was not the first
one involving a phone booth at this particular location. On February
13, 1973, some 20 months prior to plaintiff's accident, another car
struck a phone booth in this same location. 6 Following this previous
accident, defendants placed three steel &quot;bumper posts&quot;
between the phone booths and the parking lot. No such posts were
placed between the booths and Century Boulevard.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The company also states that the prior
accident caused only &quot;minor damage.&quot; The record indicates
that the accident necessitated the replacement of the phone booth.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition, plaintiff introduced a
telephone company manual which states that telephone booth doors,
when operating normally, &quot;should open with a slight pull on the
handle . . . .&quot;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">At the hearing on the motion, which was
held on August 27, 1980, the dispute between the parties centered on
whether the evidence presented triable issues of fact as to the
questions of duty and proximate cause. At the close of argument, the
court granted the motion and entered a judgment of dismissal. 7</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This appeal by the plaintiff followed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">II.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(See fn. 8.) Defendants contend that
their duty to use due care in the location, installation, and
maintenance of telephone booths does not extend to the risk
encountered by plaintiff 8 and that neither their alleged negligence
in carrying out these activities nor any defect in the booth was a
proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. These contentions present
the same issue in different guises. Each involves this question --
was the risk that a car might crash into the phone booth and injure
plaintiff reasonably foreseeable in this case? (See, e.g., Weirum v.
RKO General, Inc., supra, 15 Cal.3d 40, 45-46; Akins v. County of
Sonoma (1967) 67 Cal.2d 185, 198-199 [60 Cal.Rptr. 499, 430 P.2d 57];
see generally, 2 Harper &amp; James, Law of Torts (1956) &sect;&sect;
18.2, 20.5, at pp. 1022, 1141-1143; Rest.2d Torts, &sect; 281, coms.
e, f and h; see also Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp. (1972) 8 Cal.3d
121, 127 [104 Cal.Rptr. 433, 501 P.2d 1153].)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The relationship between a telephone
company and a user of its instrumentalities is that of invitor and
invitee. ( Jaehne v. Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. (1951) 105
Cal.App.2d 683, 687 [234 P.2d 165].) It is, of course, settled law
that &quot;one who invites another to do business with him owes the
invitee the duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent his being
injured on 'the premises.'&quot; ( Schwartz v. Helms Bakery Limited
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 232, 239 [60 Cal.Rptr. 510, 430 P.2d 68]; accord
Jaehne v. Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, at p. 688 [telephone
company owes users of its instrumentalities &quot;the duty of
maintaining its property in a reasonably safe condition, and of
exercising reasonable care in protecting [them] from injury through
its negligence&quot;].) Further, an independent contractor hired to
perform any of the aforementioned activities would have a duty
&quot;commensurate with&quot; or &quot;analogous to&quot; that of the
telephone company toward the company's invitees. (See generally,
Chance v. Lawry's, Inc. (1962) 58 Cal.2d 368, 376-379 [24 Cal.Rptr.
209, 374 P.2d 185].)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ordinarily, foreseeability is a
question of fact for the jury. ( Weirum v. RKO General, Inc., supra,
15 Cal.3d 40, 46.) It may be decided as a question of law only if,
&quot;under the undisputed facts there is no room for a reasonable
difference of opinion.&quot; ( Schrimscher v. Bryson (1976) 58
Cal.App.3d 660, 664 [130 Cal.Rptr. 125]; accord Richards v. Stanley
(1954) 43 Cal.2d 60, 66 [271 P.2d 23]; see generally, Rest.2d Torts,
&sect; 453, com. b.) Accordingly, this court must decide whether
foreseeability remains a triable issue in this case. If any triable
issue of fact exists, it is error for a trial court to grant a
party's motion for summary judgment. ( Code Civ. Proc., &sect; 437c
9; see generally, Stationers Corp. v. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc.
(1965) 62 Cal.2d 412, 417 [42 Cal.Rptr. 449, 398 P.2d 785].)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">(See fn. 10.) There is a threshold
question as to whether the facts assumed to be true by the court in
Bigbee I, supra, 93 Cal.App.3d 451 10 and the facts presented in this
case are sufficiently different to permit this court to redecide the
question as to whether foreseeability is a triable issue.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Bigbee I, the Court of Appeal
impliedly determined that under the facts alleged in the complaint,
foreseeability was a question of fact for the jury and could not be
decided adversely to plaintiff as a matter of law. (See 93 Cal.App.3d
at pp. 454-456; see generally, 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971)
Pleading, &sect; 802, p. 2415.) Under the doctrine known as the &quot;law
of the case,&quot; this court would ordinarily be required to adhere
to that ruling -- even if erroneous -- unless the evidence presented
on the second appeal were substantially different.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;[Q]uestions presented and decided
by [an] appellate court upon appeal from a judgment on demurrer
become the law of the case, and are not open to question on a
subsequent appeal&quot; unless the evidence &quot;'is substantially
different in a material respect.'&quot; ( Blatz Brewing Co. v.
Collins (1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 438, 444, 445 [160 P.2d 37]; accord
Penziner v. West American Finance Co. (1937) 10 Cal.2d 160, 169 [74
P.2d 252]; Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Minnette (1953) 115
Cal.App.2d 698, 707 [252 P.2d 642]; see generally, People v. Shuey
(1975) 13 Cal.3d 835, 840-842 [120 Cal.Rptr. 83, 533 P.2d 211].) 11</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">However, this rule applies only to
those parties who appealed and whose rights were affected by that
prior appeal. ( March v. Barnet (1898) 121 Cal. 419, 424 [53 P. 933];
see also Penziner v. West American Finance Co., supra, 10 Cal.2d at
p. 169; see generally 5 Cal.Jur.3d, Appellate Review, &sect; 653, p.
383.) Pacific Telephone and Western Electric were the only defendants
who were parties to the Bigbee I proceeding. The rights of Western
Industrial and Decker were not determined in that proceeding.
Therefore, in order to determine whether summary judgment was
properly granted as to them, this court must consider anew the
question of foreseeability. 12</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Turning to the merits of this case, the
question presented is a relatively simple one. Is there room for a
reasonable difference of opinion as to whether the risk that a car
might crash into the phone booth and injure an individual inside was
reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances set forth above?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In pursuing this inquiry, it is well to
remember that &quot;foreseeability is not to be measured by what is
more probable than not, but includes whatever is likely enough in the
setting of modern life that a reasonably thoughtful [person] would
take account of it in guiding practical conduct.&quot; (2 Harper &amp;
James, Law of Torts, supra, &sect; 18.2, at p. 1020.) One may be held
accountable for creating even &quot;'the risk of a slight possibility
of injury if a reasonably prudent [person] would not do so.'&quot; (
Ewart v. Southern Cal. Gas Co. (1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 163, 172 [46
Cal.Rptr. 631], quoting from Vasquez v. Alameda (1958) 49 Cal.2d 674,
684 [321 P.2d 1] (dis. opn. of Traynor, J.); see also Crane v. Smith
(1943) 23 Cal.2d 288, 299 [144 P.2d 356]; see generally, Rest.2d
Torts, &sect; 291.) Moreover, it is settled that what is required to
be foreseeable is the general character of the event or harm -- e.g.,
being struck by a car while standing in a phone booth -- not its
precise nature or manner of occurrence. ( Taylor v. Oakland Scavenger
Co. (1941) 17 Cal.2d 594, 600 [110 P.2d 1044]; Gibson v. Garcia
(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 681, 684 [216 P.2d 119]; see generally, Rest.2d
Torts, &sect; 435, subd. 1, com. a.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Here, defendants placed a telephone
booth, which was difficult to exit, in a parking lot 15 feet from the
side of a major thoroughfare and near a driveway. Under these
circumstances, this court cannot conclude as a matter of law that it
was unforeseeable that the booth might be struck by a car and cause
serious injury to a person trapped within. A jury could reasonably
conclude that this risk was foreseeable. (Cf. Barker v. Wah Low
(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 710, 723 [97 Cal.Rptr. 85] [reasonable jurors
could find that the chance that a car in the parking lot of a
drive-in restaurant might strike a patron at the adjacent service
counter was foreseeable]. ) This is particularly true where, as here,
there is evidence that a booth at this same location had previously
been struck. (See, ante, pp. 54-55 and fn. 6.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Indeed, in light of the circumstances
of modern life, it seems evident that a jury could reasonably find
that defendants should have foreseen the possibility of the very
accident which actually occurred here. Swift traffic on a major
thoroughfare late at night is to be expected. Regrettably, so too are
intoxicated drivers. (See Coulter v. Superior Court, supra, 21 Cal.3d
144, 154.) Moreover, it is not uncommon for speeding and/or
intoxicated drivers to lose control of their cars and crash into
poles, buildings or whatever else may be standing alongside the road
they travel -- no matter how straight and level that road may be.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Where a telephone booth, which is
difficult to exit, is placed 15 feet from such a thoroughfare, the
risk that it might be struck by a car veering off the street, thereby
causing injury to a person trapped within, cannot be said to be
unforeseeable as a matter of law.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It is of no consequence that the harm
to plaintiff came about through the negligent or reckless acts of
Roberts. 13 &quot;If the likelihood that a third person may act in a
particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the
actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent,
intentionally tortious, or criminal does not prevent the actor from
being liable for harm caused thereby.&quot; ( Rest.2d Torts, &sect;
449; accord Weirum v. RKO General, Inc., supra, 15 Cal.3d 40, 46;
Vesely v. Sager (1971) 5 Cal.3d 153, 164 [95 Cal.Rptr. 623, 486 P.2d
151]; Richardson v. Ham (1955) 44 Cal.2d 772, 777 [285 P.2d 269]; see
also Cronin v. J.B.E. Olson Corp., supra, 8 Cal.3d 121, 126-127.)
Here, the risk that a car might hit the telephone booth could be
found to constitute one of the hazards to which plaintiff was
exposed.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Other courts considering cases
presenting factual situations similar to this one have reached
precisely the same conclusions. (See, e.g., Noon v. Knavel (1975) 234
Pa.Super. 198 [339 A.2d 545]; Brinkley v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Company (Fla.App. 1977) 353 So.2d 593; see generally,
Annot., Liability of Telephone Company for Injury Resulting From
Condition or Location of Telephone Booth, supra, 17 A.L.R.4th 1308.)
In Brinkley a car, driven by a person who was allegedly drunk, struck
a telephone booth in a shopping center parking lot. The court thought
the question of foreseeability was so obviously a triable issue that
it reversed a summary judgment for the telephone company in a
two-paragraph opinion.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Noon v. Knavel, supra, 339 A.2d 545,
involved an accident in which the plaintiff was struck by a car while
standing in a telephone booth located on the premises of a gas
station. The booth was situated at the bottom of a long downgrade
about 10 feet from the edge of the street and about 5 feet from a
railroad crossing. The accident occurred when the car's brakes failed
and the car ricocheted off a train at the crossing and crashed
through the telephone booth. (Id., at pp. 547-548.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The court affirmed a jury verdict
against the telephone company after concluding that the company was
under a duty to use due care to protect users of the booth from the
accidental, negligent or reckless acts of drivers. The risk of a
railroad crossing accident was found to be among the foreseeable
hazards which made the location of the booth unreasonably dangerous.
Accordingly, the court concluded that the telephone company's
negligence, in failing to use due care in positioning the booth, was
a proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries. (Id., at pp. 549-552.)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Considering the case law and the
circumstances of this case, this court cannot conclude as a matter of
law that injury to plaintiff, inflicted by negligent or reckless
third party drivers, was unforeseeable. &quot;[Just] as we may not
rely upon our private judgment on this issue, so the trial court may
not impose its private judgment upon a situation, such as this, in
which reasonable minds may differ.&quot; ( Schwartz v. Helms Bakery
Limited, supra, 67 Cal.2d 232, 244.) 14</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This is not to say, of course, that
defendants are liable for plaintiff's injury. This court decides only
that this question is one that should be reserved for a jury.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Since the foreseeability of harm to
plaintiff remains a triable issue of fact, the judgment is reversed
and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings
consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</P>
