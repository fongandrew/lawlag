  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I think this is a pretty accurate metaphor for our justice system in general.</p>
    <p>See <a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bonds/popovhayashi121802dec.pdf"><i>Popov v. Hayashi</i></a> [PDF]. Alex Popov caught Barry Bond's seventy-third home run. Or rather, he almost did, because as soon as the ball hit his glove, he was swarmed by a "band of wrongdoers", causing him to lose control of the ball. In the ensuing mayhem, Dennis Hayashi picked up the ball and refused to give it back to Popov, precipitating a lawsuit over who owned said ball. Unable to determine whether Popov would have maintained possession of the ball had he not been assaulted, the judge decided to do the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Solomon">Solomonic</a> thing: Sell the ball and split the proceeds.</p>
    <p>On an unrelated note, I still have some <a href="http://<domain>/images/merch/notaduck/green.png">duck</a> <a href="http://<domain>/images/merch/notaduck/navyblue.png">shirts</a> on sale at $15 per shirt. E-mail andrew AT tortbunnies DOT com if you're interested.</p>
