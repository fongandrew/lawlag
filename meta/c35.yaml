  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. It's summer and finals are over, but I'm working on the California Law Review write-on. It's a grueling process in which students spend a week or so after finals writing and editing, all for the right to spend the next two years doing even more writing and editing. Go me.</p>
    <p>Also, I altered the borders and formatting somewhat. The older comics may look a little off until I get around to updating the images.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Rachel and Cara.</p>
