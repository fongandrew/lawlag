    <p><b><date></b>. I've always wondered why law firms bill by the hour. It's a huge moral hazard. I have yet to work at a firm, so I don't know exactly what the justification is, but I can think of a few off the top of my head:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lawsuits involve substantial uncertainty. What seems like a simple legal problem may end up being much more complicated as new facts are discovered. With hourly billing, the cost of this uncertainty is passed on to clients, who, in theory, are better able to mitigiate it. That might make sense for some litigation, but I imagine that most transactional work is fairly routine.</li>
      <li>Competition among firms will drive lawyers to minimize costs and bill fewer hours. However, while this is true for the market over the long term, it's not true for firms in the short term. There are plenty of examples where managers choose short term payoffs at the expense of long term benefits. Having a system which makes such behavior possible seems like a bad idea.</li>
      <li>Lawyers have an ethical responsibility to not cheat their clients (that's the reason given in the comic). Two responses: (1) The problem is not that lawyers are consciously choosing to overbill their clients but that they're making subconscious calculations to not work as efficiently as possible. (2) Not all lawyers are ethical.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thoughts?</p>

  transcript: |
    Bushy Dough Lop stands in front of a Powerpoint presentation. ;
    He looks like Negligent Lop with a Colonel Sanders mustache. ;
    Bushy Dough Lop: Here at Hare, Hop, & Lop, we
                     look after not only our clients'
                     legal interests, but their
                     financial interests as well. ;
    -----
    Bushy Dough Lop: That's  why it's important that
                     you, as summer associates, work
                     quickly to minimize the number
                     of hours we bill our clients. ;
    Bushy Dough Lop: Yes, question? ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: If we're trying to save our clients
                  money, then why are we billing
                  them by the hour to begin with?
                  Doesn't that create an incentive
                  to waste time and money? ;
    -----
    Bushy Dough Lop: Good question. The answer is no,
                     because we require all associates
                     to live by a strict code of honor. ;
    Bushy Dough Lop: We expect any associate
                     caught billing more hours
                     than necessary to commit
                     ritual suicide rather than
                     dishonor the firm. ;
    -----
    The slide changes to an image of a knife-like object. ;
    Bushy Dough Lop: The preferred method is
                     disembowelment with this
                     rusty letter opener. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: That seems excess-- ;
    Bushy Dough Lop: DEATH BEFORE DISHONOR! ;
