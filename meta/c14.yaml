    <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15016094375983030108"><i>Nelson
    v. Driscoll</i></a>, 295 Mont. 363 (1999), where the plaintiff''s wife was pulled
    over by a police officer on suspicion of drunk driving. The officer could not
    establish that she was actually intoxicated and therefore did not believe he had
    grounds to arrest her on a DUI. However, given admissions by both the plaintiff
    and his wife that they had been drinking earlier, the officer forbade the two
    from further driving that night. The two decided to walk home instead, and the
    wife was killed when she was hit by a drunk driver. The court held that whether
    or not the officer should be held liable for her death was a valid jury question.</p>
