  alt: Wait, you're a rabbit. Why are you wearing shoes to begin with?

    <p><b><date></b>. Fun fact: <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=h&amp;p=8">"Heeled"</a> once meant "furnished with a gun."</p>
    <p>I've had variations of this conversation with many people, but this particular comic was inspired by Tracy.</p>
  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny walks past some buildings with graffiti and down a sidewalk. ;
    CLOP CLOP CLOP. ;
    She's wearing pink high-heels. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny trips on a pothole. ;
    TRIP! ;
    Tort Bunny: AUGHHH!!!!! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit helps her up. ;
    Tort Bunny: Brown, get your
                car and give me
                a ride to the
                courthouse. ;
    Brown Rabbit: What? But it's only
                  three blocks away. ;
    Tort Bunny: I'm wearing heels. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: I really don't see why you
                  have to wear those things. ;
    Tort Bunny: It's because we live in
                a patriarchal society. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit raises an eyebrow. His left eyebrow to be precise. ;
    Brown Rabbit: The man is forcing you to wear heels? ;
    Tort Bunny: No, the man is looking down on
                me. Literally. Men are taller and 
                thus more intimidating. Heels let
                me close the height gap while
                maintaining my feminity. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Surely there's another-- ;
    Tort Bunny: I could also walk into court
                carrying this pink handgun. ;
    Tort Bunny points said pink handgun in Brown Rabbit's face. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Right, heels it is. ;
