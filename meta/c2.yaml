  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. See <a href="http://<domain>/cases/krebs_v_corrigan.html"><i>Krebs
    v. Corrigan</i>, 321 A.2d 558 (D.C. 1974)</a>, in which the defendant flew three
    feet off the ground and landed on the plaintiff''s plexiglass sculptures, destroying
    them. The court held that "a person''s body usually is within his exclusive control"
    and that under the doctrine of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_ipsa_loquitur">res
    ipsa loquitur</a></i>, the burden was on the defendant to explain why he was flying through the
    air.</p>


    <p>On a different note, I have been informed that it is highly implausible that
    consumers of iron supplements will be attracted to large magnets. To that, I note
    the laws of physics in the Tort Bunnies universe are subject to interpretation.</p>'
