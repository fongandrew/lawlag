  transcript: |
    Hiring Partner (off-panel): So Ms. Usagi, why do you
                                want to work at our firm? ;
    Lucy Usagi: Oh, lots of reasons! ;
    -----
    Lucy Usagi: But a big part of why I want
                to work at Poop-on-a-stick is
                its commitment to diversity. ;
    -----
    Hiring Partner (off-panel): The firm's name is not ... uh ...
                                it's pronounced Puponastich. ;
    Lucy Usagi: Didn't I say that? Maybe
                my accent's too diverse. ;
