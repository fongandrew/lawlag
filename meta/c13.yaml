    transcript: |
      Tort Bunny kicks Brown Rabbit off a building. ;
      -----
      Brown Rabbit: Peril! Help help, I am in need!
                    To superheroes I do plead! ;
      -----
      Brown Rabbit: Hurray, salvation I do see! ;
      Superbunny appears, looking suspiciously like Tort Bunny. ;
      Superbunny: 'Tis true should you
                  contract with me. ;
      -----
      Brown Rabbit: A contract? Surely you must jest,
                    because clearly this is duress. ;
      Superbunny: There is no threat to worsen
                  what otherwise would have been. ;
      -----
      Superbunny: I have no duty to rescue,
                  so a bargain must be made.
                  Convey to me Blackacre,
                  if today your life I save. ;
      -----
      Brown Rabbit: Fine, fine, I shall agree.
                    Now will you please rescue me? ;
      Superbunny: I'm afraid I can't. Despite my diction,
                  I'm nothing more than legal fiction. ;
      Superbunny vanishes in a puff of smoke. Poof!
