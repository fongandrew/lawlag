    <p><b><date></b>. Dear 1Ls, you don't have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(law)#Professional_vs._student_briefs">brief cases</a> if you don't want to. Highlighting your book, asking a friend for help, using a Westlaw brief, Googling the case, or just taking the day off are all perfectly acceptable ways to prepare for class.</p>
    <p>The haiku in the first panel comes from <a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/faculty/facultyProfile.php?facID=7062">Professor Neil Levy</a>'s description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palsgraf_v._Long_Island_Railroad_Co.">Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co.</a>, 248 N.Y. 339 (1928):</p>
