  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Recall that <a href="31.html">Brown Rabbit's computer burst into flames</a> last week, hence why he can't just print out another outline.</p>
    <p>For confused non-law-school-students, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school_outlines">law school outlines</a>. Some professors, in addition to letting you use an outline to study before an exam, also permit you to use your own self-prepared outline during an exam. Half-eaten outlines are not much use in those scenarios.</p>
    <p>Also, if anyone is curious, the word Brown Rabbit is thinking of is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frak_(expletive)">"Frack"</a>.</p>

    Tort Bunny: Silly rabbit! It's not the outline that

                By reviewing and organizing all that
                you know about a subject, you've more
                than prepared yourself to take this test! ;

    Tort Bunny: Yes you will! ;
    Brown Rabbit: Yes I will! ;
    The two of them high five - four - one, whatever it is when two rabbits slap paws together. ;
    -----
