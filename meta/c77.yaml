  description: Negligent Lop sets the tone for the semester.

  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Okay, so maybe we'll start with a three-panel before <a href="http://<domain>/76.html#notes">going back to a six-panels</a>.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, Negligent Lop isn't entirely correct. There are <i>some</i> reasons for 2Ls with summer jobs to care about their grades. Summer internships don't always turn into full-time offers, in which case your grades might matter during OCI as a 3L. Or maybe you want to clerk. And you do need to pass your classes to graduate.</p>
    <p>But for the most part, 2Ls don't care anymore.  It's like Senioritis in high school or college -- except it lasts for a year-and-a-half (and then some).</p>
  transcript: |
    Negligent Lop and Brown Rabbit are walking down the hall together. ;
    Negligent Lop: As a 2L with a summer job,
                   my grades no longer matter. ;
    Negligent Lop: I've therefore resolved to be
                   more chill this semeseter. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: I'm going to enjoy my status as
                   an irresponsible young adult male
                   student by sleeping more, drinking
                   more, and partying more. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: How is that different from
                  the last three semesters? ;
    Negligent Lop: The "more" is an important modifier. ;
