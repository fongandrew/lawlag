  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I don't what the Constitution has to do with pumpkin pies, but Thanksgiving is rolling around. And pumpkin pie is delicious.</p>
    <p>Also, U.S. dollars used to be pegged to Spanish "bits of eight", so a "bit" is worth roughly 12.5 cents. In which case the 2-bit hooker is quite cheap and Negligent Lop just might be charging a reasonable rate.</p>
  transcript: |
    Negligent Lop: Your honor, this statute is as
                   constitutional as pumpkin pie. ;
    Judge (off-panel): Hold on, weren't you arguing the
                       exact opposite three weeks ago? ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: I ... uh ... this is a different client. ;
    Judge (off-panel): So you're prostituting your
                       integrity to the highest bidder. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: I prefer to think of it as
                   more of an escort service. ;
    Judge (off-panel): You say tomato, I
                       say two-bit hooker. ;
    Negligent Lop: 1200-bit, your honor. Per hour. ;
