  description: I'd say good luck to everyone writing on, but that would defeat the purpose of saying good luck.
  alt: The alternative to this strip was something involving 99 red balloons, but I couldn't think of any lyrics that would work. Maybe later.
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I walked through the student center the other day, where various 1Ls (rising 2Ls) were frantically working on their write-on packets, all to enter that hallowed order called the Law Review. And I wondered, "Did it smell this bad when I was here last year?"</p>
