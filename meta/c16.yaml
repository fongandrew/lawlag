  description: Four reasons why sitting in the front row of class is a bad idea.
  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. This one''s been stewing for a while. I figured that the
    start of a new semester would be a good time to whip it out.</p>

    <p>I''m not quite sure how Brown Rabbit and Tort Bunny switched places in the
    top right panel. Perhaps they sit next to each other in two different classes
    -- meaning Brown Rabbit and Tort Bunny probably have a weird relationship (or
    stalker-ship) going on.</p>

    <p>Also, I don''t have Torts this semester -- I have a few Torts-related comics
    lined up, but expect the next weeks to be predominantly based on some combination
    of Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Criminal Law. The name of the strip,
    however, will not change (again). CivPro Bunnies just doesn''t quite have the
    same ring. That said, the Google juice for Tort Bunnies is not as high as it could
    be. So if you have a blog or something, please link to tortbunnies.com!</p>
    
    <p><b>Update (February 10, 2010):</b> Half the class hopping on <a href="http://buzz.google.com/">Google Buzz</a> at the same time is not good for productivity.</p>
    <p><b>Update (August 6, 2010):</b> Buzz sucks. Back to chat.</p>
