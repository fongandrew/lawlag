    BATTERY! ; 
    Tort Bunny kicks Brown Rabbit between the legs ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Liability! Liability for the harm to my balls! ;
    Tort Bunny: But battery requires intent!
                I knew not of your balls and
                thus could not have
                intended them harm. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: But to prove battery, I need
                  only to show intent of harmful
                  touching, not the
                  actual harm itself! ;
    Tort Bunny: I am thwarted! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: I have been wronged and
                  demand justice!
                  Compensatory damages
                  for my suffering! And
                  punitive damages as well! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: My lawyers will feast
                  upon your assets
                  today Tort Bunny! ;
    Tort Bunny: Nay! For I have
                neither money
                nor tort insurance! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: I am thwarted! ;

    <p><b><date></b>. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garratt_v._Dailey"><i>Garratt v. Dailey</i>, 46 Wash.2d 19, 279 P.2d 1091 (1955)</a>. I suppose you could point to other battery / intent cases as well, but this was the first case I read in law school, so it gets to be the inspiration for the first strip. The case is interesting because it shows that (1) the relevant intent is that of offensive contact (or "touching" as Professor Levy puts it) and (2) you can sue a 5-year-old kid. Why sue a 5-year-old kid? Because he has money. Clearly.</p>
