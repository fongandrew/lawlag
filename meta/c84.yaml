  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. The U.S. Constitution creates a federal government of limited enumerated powers. One of those powers is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause">regulation of interstate commerce</a>. The scope of the power has changed over time. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._United_States"><i>Schechter Poultry Corp v. United States</i></a>, the Court held that the federal government could not outlaw the sale of sick chickens if those chickens were not sold across state lines. However, seven years later, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn"><i>Wickard v. Filburn</i></a>, the Court held that a farmer's growing of wheat to feed his cattle affected interstate commerce, because by growing wheat, he no longer had to purchase wheat from the larger interstate market. See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Lopez"><i>United States v. Lopez</i></a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Morrison"><i>United States v. Morrison</i></a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich"><i>Gonzales v. Raich</i></a>.</p>

    Professor Fluffybottom: Mr. Lop, can you reconcile Wickard v.
                            Filburn's understanding of interstate
                            commerce with the Schechter case? ;
    Negligent Lop is playing Robot Unicorn Attack on his laptop. ;
    Negligent Lop: Uh ... ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: Yes ... if I could just check
                   my notes, uh ... so Wickard
                   is really about wheat ... ;
    Negligent Lop: ... fed to cows. Wheat fed to cows. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: And cows fart! Big interstate farts. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: Schechter Poultry, on the other
                   hand, was about chickens. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: What is chicken? ;
    Negligent Lop: A bird with farts that have
                   only a de minimis impact on
                   interstate commerce. ;
    -----
    Professor Fluffybottom (off-panel): Um ... just so you know, it's
                                        okay to pass when you
                                        haven't done the reading. ;
    Negligent Lop: But I did do the reading! ;
