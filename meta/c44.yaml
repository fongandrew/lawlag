  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. The hiring market is not good. There is some tension between picking the firms you want to work at and the firms you have a snowball's chance in hell of working at.</p>
    <p>For the record, if you are the hiring partner at a firm I applied to, I absolutely picked your firm because I want to work there and not because I thought it would be comparatively easy to get a job at. Honest!</p>

                  working on interesting stuff. ;

                  is arguing a high profile case
                  before the Supreme Court that
                  could radically alter carrot law. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: And this firm here is handling a
                  complex transaction between the two
                  largest producers of letter openers. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Surprisingly high demand
                  for those nowadays. ;
