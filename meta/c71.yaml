  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit and the Ghost of Law School Yet to Come walk towards a CarrotHouse restaurant. ;
    Brown Rabbit: What now? Are we getting
                  a snack? Can ghosts eat? ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: 'Cuz I'm really hung-- ;
    Brown Rabbit sees that Brown Rabbit
    Yet to Come is wearing a CarrotHouse
    uniform, complete with demeaning cap,
    standing behind the conuter. ;
    Brown Rabbit Yet to Come: Ma'am, did you get my memo? ;
    Manager (off-panel): Memo? ;
    Brown Rabbit Yet to Come: That thing with all the ids? ;
    -----
    Manager (off-panel): Oh that thing. ;
    Brown Rabbit Yet to Come: Yes, the duty of care-- ;
    Manager (off-panel): Brown, the only duty you have
                         is to deliver a jumbo-sized grilled
                         carrot patty in under 45 seconds. ;
    -----
    We wee that the manager is Lucy Usagi,
    also wearing a CarrotHouse uniform,
    albeit without the demeaning cap. ;
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come: Look, I don't like you. And those big
                            law firms must not like you either,
                            or else you'd be working for them. ;
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come: Fortunately, you don't
                            need an award-winning
                            personality to work here. ;
    -----
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come (off-panel): But if you keep this crap up,
                                        you're gone. Understand? ;
    Brown Rabbit Yet to Come: Yes Ma'am. ;
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come (off-panel): Oh, and one more thing. ;
    -----
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come (off-panel): Drop the "esquire." 
                                        Esquire is a magazine
                                        with pretty ladies in it. ;
    Lucy Usagi Yet to Come (off-panel): And you are no pretty lady. ;
