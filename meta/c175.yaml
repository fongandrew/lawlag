  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>.
      Brown Rabbit needs a vacation, and I need one too.
      You may have noticed the subheading on the site has been changed from "Updated Mondays + Whenever" to just "Updated Whenever". That's intentional.
      <a href="http://<domain>/160.html">As I mentioned earlier</a>, I'd keep this going until the bar. And now that I'm done with the bar (hopefully), I think it's time to take a break. I may update from time to time, but it probably won't be that frequently from now on. I am interested in posting guest comics though. I haven't fully thought guest-posting through, but let me know if you're interested in drawing (or copy-pasting) your own Tort Bunnies. My contact info is in the homepage footer.
    </p><p>
      Once again, thanks for reading folks. It's been fun, but I think it's time for me to take a jaunt along the edges of an undiscovered country. Good luck everyone.

  transcript: |
    Superbunny streaks towards a flaming orage, red, and yellow asteroid. ;
    -----
    NOT BATTERY! ;
    A tiny white spark on the surface of the asteroid. ;
    -----
    Massive explosion, complete with fragments of the asteroid bursting forth
    from the center faster than an unrealistic vertical Death Star / Praxis ring. ;
    -----
    The assembled crowd from the previous strip cheers. ;
    -----
    As a bright light approaches, the cheers turn to panic as folks disperse. ;
    -----
    A streak of white, orange, and pink strikes Brown RAbbit. ;
    BATTERY! ;
    -----
    Superbunny and Brown Rabbit crawl forth from the smoking hole in the ground, as Fran√ßois le Duc and Negligent Lop look on. ;
    Tort Bunny (as Superbunny): My bad. I was aiming for the duck. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I need a vacation. ;
