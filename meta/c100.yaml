  transcript: |
    Prof. Hobbes: Practically speaking, there is
                  not much difference between
                  the numbers 99, 100, and 101. ;
    Prof. Hobbes: But as a round number, 100
                  possesses a certain beauty
                  not found in its neighbors. ;
    -----
    Prof. Hobbes (off-panel): Round numbers are symbolic. ;
    Prof. Hobbes (off-panel): Testaments to our collective attempts
                              to impose order and meaning upon the
                              mysteries of rabbits and the universe. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: So you're rounding up our
                  tuition for aesthetic reasons? ;
    Prof. Hobbes (off-panel): No, we're rounding it
                              up because we can. ;
