    <p><b><date></b>. It's legally permissible to make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_pleading">multiple contradictory arguments</a>. It may not be strategically sound, but it is legal. This example deals with multiple defenses, but you can also have multiple contradictory allegations in a complaint as well. See <i><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13901788718606473458">McCormick v. Kopmann</a></i>, 161 N.E.2d 720 (1959), where the plaintiff alleged both (1) that her husband was not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributory_negligence">contributorily negligent</a> in a car accident which took his life and (2) that if he was, it was because a bar had let him drive drunk.</p>

                balls. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: In the alternative,
                I only kick them
                in the balls when
                they totally have
                it coming. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: In the alternative,
                Negligent Lop kicked
                Brown Rabbit in the
                balls, not I. ;

                Brown Rabbit
                has no balls. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: In the alternative, I did
                kick him the balls
                and there's nothing you
                can do about it! ;
    Tort Bunny: Because I am a
                MASTER NINJA! ;

    from behind a desk. ;
    Judge (off-screen): Were you supposed to
                        vanish? Because I ...
                        uh ... I can still see you. ;
    Tort Bunny: In the alternative, I am a
                Master Ninja in training. ;
