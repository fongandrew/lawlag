    <p><b><date></b>. This is <a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2012/03/13/belgian-rightsholders-group-wants-to-charge-libraries-for-reading-books-to-kids/">a real thing</a>, albeit in Belgium rather than America. Crazy, huh? Copyright law in most countries grants the author of a work the exclusive right to publicly perform that work. The right usually pertains to movies, plays, or music, but apparently it also covers reading works aloud. In the U.S., the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a> doctrine protects certain activities that would otherwise be infringing. However, using a work in its entirety, in a non-transformative manner, weighs against a finding of fair use.</p>

    Brown Rabbit: Hey! That's a copyrighted work! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: So? ;
    Brown Rabbit: So reading it aloud to children
                  constitutes a public performance!
                  You need a license to do that. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: This isn't fair use? ;
    Brown Rabbit: You're reading it word
                  for word! There's no
                  way that's fair use. ;
