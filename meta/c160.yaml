  description: Negligent Lop foresees Brown Rabbit's future. 
  alt: And then we become lawyers.
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. So, I should probably comment a bit on the future of this comic strip now that I've graduated. I think I'll keep this going for a little while, at least until the bar. But at some point in the near future, Tort Bunnies will come to a conclusion. Or be on a hiatus. Or something. Tort Bunnies has always been informed by my day-to-day life, or the day-to-day lives of the people around me, so once I start working, client confidentiality and all that jazz will probably make that sort of commentary difficult.</p>
    <p>That's not to say I'll be all memo and no drawing. The thought of being (only) a lawyer absolutely terrifies me. I fully intend to find the time to be creative. It just might not be Tort Bunnies anymore.</p>
    <p>On a more positive note, I want to thank you, my readers. Since I've started this webcomic, I've never failed to post a new comic each Monday. And that's largely because of the feedback and kind words I get from all of you. So thank you.</p>
    <p>I'm planning a cross-country road trip after the bar, August to September-ish. If you want me to come visit, let me know. No promises, but I'll see if I can swing by and say hi. Or if you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, let me know and we can work something out too.</p>
