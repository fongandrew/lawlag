  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. <a href="http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Internal_Revenue_Code:Sec._165._Losses">Section 165 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code</a> allows taxpayers to claim a deduction for losses. Taxpayers may claim deductions for personal casualty losses, or "losses of property not connected with a trade or business or a transaction entered into for profit, if such losses arise from fire, storm, shipwreck, or other casualty, or from theft," only to the extent that such losses exceed $100 and 10% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.</p>
    <p>No such restriction exists for business losses.</p>
    <p>A note on cats: A professor I knew had several pet cats. I once asked him why he had so many cats. He responded, "Cats are evil and selfish. And I teach tax law."</p>

  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit dons a green eyeshade at the Law School Tax Clinic. ;
    A dim yellow light is perched overhead. ;
    Shadowy Character (off-panel): Mr. Rabbit? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Yes? ;
    -----
    Two yellow eyes glow in the darkness of a doorframe. ;
    Shadowy Figure: I have a tax issue arising from ...
                    an associate of mine who recently
                    sank to the bottom of the ocean. ;
    Brown Rabbit (off-panel): I'm sorry to hear that. ;
    Shadowy Figure: I'm not. ;
    -----
    Shadowy Figure (off-panel): She was a liar and a thief.
                                She burglarized my home. ;
    Shadowy Figure (off-panel): And she took the secret of
                                where she hid her ill-gotten
                                gains to her watery grave. ;
    Cut to image of a bunny with concrete shoes swimming with the fishes. ;
    -----
    The figure hands over a Form 1040 for the couple of James Meowreth and Susan Gatto. ;
    Their address is "Old Cardboard Box by the Fence, Unit 12, Bunkley, CA 94720". ;
    Author's note: I was this close to making them reside in "Oh-hai-yo". ;
    Shadowy Figure: So as it is, I wish to amend my tax
                    return and deduct the $10,000 in
                    stolen goods I will never recover. ;
    Brown Rabbit (off-panel): Do you have any other losses? ;
    Shadowy Figure: No. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: You're out of luck then. Your
                  adjusted gross income is more
                  than $100,000, and you can only
                  deduct a personal casualty loss-- ;
    Shadowy Figure (off-panel): Personal? ;
    -----
    Shadowy Figure: It's never personal, Mr. Rabbit. ;
    The shadowy figure steps into the light, revealing himself to be a cat with a yellow tie. ;
    Shadowy Figure: I'm a Business Cat. ;
