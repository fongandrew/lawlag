  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: Wotcha up to? ;
    Tort Bunny: Putting a message
                into this bottle ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny places her message in a bottle and the bottle into a stream. ;
    Tort Bunny: This stream flows into a river ;
    Tort Bunny: That river into a sea ;
    Tort Bunny: That sea into an ocean. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Who knows what distant shores
                that bottle may reach?
    Brown Rabbit: Well, it could be discovered
                  by indigenous peoples that
                  have never had contact
                  with other civilizations.
    Brown Rabbit: And treat the bottle as
                  a gift from the gods.
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: And then wage war with each other
                  over who gets to own the bottle!
    Brown Rabbit: Until they are stopped by a lawyer
    Brown Rabbit: Who traces the bottle back to you
    Brown Rabbit: And sues you for negligently
                  altering the natural course of
                  a people&#39;s cultural evolution! 
    -----

    Brown Rabbit: Wait, wha-
    Tort Bunny: The message is a murder
                confession by the way.
