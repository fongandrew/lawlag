  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I came up with this one while talking to my Contracts professor.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, a plaintiff in a suit at law (as opposed to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitable_remedies">suit in equity</a>) can only demand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages">monetary damages</a>. For a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_contract">breach of contract</a>, a plaintiff normally receives <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_damages">expectation damages</a>, or enough money to restore the injured party to where they expected to be had the contract been performed. In this case however, because a duck is worth more than a carrot, the defendant's breach of contract has actually increased the plaintiff's monetary position. Suing for a breach of contract here would be like suing someone for giving you too much money.</p>
    <p>Fortunately, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_tender_rule">Section 2-601 of the Uniform Commercial Code</a>, Tort Bunny should be able to reject François and demand the carrot she ordered. Failing that, she can leave François on the counter and ask for a refund.</p>
    <p>That's not Tort Bunny's style though. She's going to take François home, gripe about it on Facebook, and then come back to this shop to open up a righteous can of whoop-ass.</p>
    <p>Oh, and to all those about to criticize my French: "Fermez le fuc en haut." That's Duck for: "Thank you for your feedback, but the Duckish language bears only a superficial resemblance to French. Quack quack quack."</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMWi7CLoZ2Q">Om nom nom.</a></p>

    Counter Rabbit: Oh, did you want onion
                    rings instead of fries? ;
    -----

    Tort Bunny: Yes. No. I mean, this is a duck. ;
    -----
    Counter Rabbit: So? ;
    Tort Bunny: So it's not a carrot. ;
    Counter Rabbit: Oh, I know, but this duck is
