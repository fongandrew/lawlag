    <p><b><date></b>. I don't think you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark">trademark</a> a pink bow. But then again, I was pretty sure you couldn't trademark a phrase you didn't invent. <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/11/10/nintendo-requests-its-on-like-donkey-kong-trademark/">Nintendo apparently disagrees.</a></p>
