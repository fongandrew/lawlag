  description: Tort Bunny tries to get a job from Negligent Lop
  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. Whoa, it''s a new year! Time for new beginnings, or in
    our case, a rehashing of <a href="http://share.tortbunnies.com/1.html">Tort Bunnies
    #1</a>.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, is the Lop liable for Tort Bunny''s tort against Brown Rabbit? It depends
    on whether the battery was in the course of her employment. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior">the
    doctrine of respondeat superior</a>. I''ll leave the question of what Tort Bunny''s
    job was up to your imagination (or a future comic strip).</p>

    <p>You also might be wondering how Tort Bunny has no assets, when we''ve already
    established that she <a href="http://share.tortbunnies.com/4.html">drives</a>
    <a href="http://share.tortbunnies.com/14.html">a red car-shaped box</a>. Two answers:
    (1) She isn''t the actual owner; (2) Continuity is not my top priority.</p>

    <p>Happy New Year all!</p>
