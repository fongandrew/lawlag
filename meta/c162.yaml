  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Some context:</p>
    <p>BarBri has been having <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barbri/posts/418498531515278">issues</a> with its AMP software.</p>
    <p>BarBri lecturer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_G._Epstein">David G. Epstein</a> uses the phrase <a href="http://lawhog.blogspot.com/2008/07/1-day.html">&quot;Armadillos From Texas Play Rap, Eating Tacos&quot;</a> as a mnemoic for the major areas of contract law: Applicable law, Formation, Terms, Performance, Remedies, Excused performance, and Third party issues. His hypos almost always involve grits, his 1973 Cadillac, Sharon Stone, Kinky Friedman, or <a href="http://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/faculty/full-time-faculty/richard-j-conviser">Professor Richard J. Conviser</a>.</p>
    <p>Under the Uniform Commercial Code, in a shipment contract, the risk of loss passes from seller to buyer when the seller (1) gets the goods to a common carrier, (2) makes reasonable arrangements for delivery, and (3) notifies the buyer. The phrase F.O.B., followed by the seller's location, indicates a shipment contract.</p>

    Brown Rabbit: BarBri AMP is down again!
                  This is outrageous! What
                  are we paying them for? ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: We did get an armadillo
                   from Texas who performs
                   rap and eats tacos. ;
    -----
    Armadillo: Alright, hit me. ;
    Armadillo: Contract with Conviser,
               sold a bag full of grits
               He calls me to complain,
               "Boy, what the hell is this?" ;
    -----
    Armadillo: Says on inspectin' the sack,
               he saw rats takin' a piss.
               But my grits weren't shit
               when the carrier shipped it ;
    Armadillo: So I say, "F.O.B. me,
               it's a shipment contract.
               I gave you grits in a sack,
               you owe me a Cadillac." ;
    -----
    Armadillo: If you having contract problems,
               I feel bad for you son.
               I got 99 problems,
               but a breach ain't one. ;
    *munch*
    *munch* ;
    The armadillo eats the taco. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Well, that was different. ;
