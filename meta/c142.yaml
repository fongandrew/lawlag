  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. The Seventh Amendment to the United States reads: "In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law." Why twenty dollars? I dunno. Here's the best explanation I could think of.</p>
    <p>See also <i>The Twenty Dollars Clause</i>, 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1665 (2005).</p>

                   by jury shall be preserved--" ;

    James Madison: As I was saying, "In suits at common
                   law, where the value in controversy
                   shall exceed twenty dollars ... " ;
