    <p><b><date></b>. See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO68zwTXFWk">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method#Law_school">cold calling</a>. My Torts professor once told a story about how a classmate of his, upon being called on, hid behind the desk. Unfortunately, the professor stayed in the room for the class after that, so the hiding classmate couldn't leave the room for another hour. Rabbits, however, are not content to hide. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycQIiA7dnKQ">Rabbits dig</a>.</p>

  transcript: |
    Professor (off-screen): Moving on, would anyone care to
                            use a personal anecdote to provide
                            a rationale for the defendant's
                            impulsive behavior that I will then
                            thoroughly decimate with magic
