  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Kudos to Justin for reminding me that it's <a href="http://www.talklikeapirate.com/">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>!</p>
    <p>For reference, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Tort_Statute">Alien Tort Statute</a>, also known as the Alien Tort Claims Act, grants federal courts jurisidction over "civil action[s] by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States." The Supreme Court ruled that these actions were limited to claims such as "violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy." <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6103279683071618777"><i>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain</i></a>, 542 U.S. 692, 724 (2004). Lower court cases have interpreted this to require that the defedant in an Alien Tort Statute claim be acting in concert with a state. <i>See</i> <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10755590652720519638"><i>Abdullahi v. Pfizer</i></a>, 562 F.3d 163 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>
    <p>I apologize to everyone who wanted this comic to involve little green men instead of pirates. ARRR.</p>

    Professor (off-panel): Ms. Bunny, can you tell me how
                           courts have limited the scope
                           of the Alien Tort Statute? ;
    Tort Bunny: Um ... the 2d Circuit requires
                state action, right? So courts-- ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Professor, I disagree
                  with the court here. ;
    Brown Rabbit: The Alien Tort Statute was
                  historically used to bring
                  claims for acts of piracy. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: And pirates are non-state actors! ;

    Blam! ;
    A cannon ball flies over Brown Rabbit's head. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop is wearing a pirate hat, an eyepatch, and a hook hand. ;
    He also has a cannon. ;
    Negligent Lop: Maties, this landlubber says pirates
                   be nothing but bilge rats chasing
                   grog. Actually, ye olde pirates were
                   corsairs for the Barbary States an'
                   privateers for the English Crown,
                   a respectable state-sponsored lot! ;
