  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny stares at her exam. ;
    -----
    We see part of a crim law hypo. ;
    It goes something like this: ;
    Final Exam ;
    Question 1. In order to lose weight for a new role, actor Keanu Cruise has been on strict vegan
    diet. After a leading film critic lambasted his acting abilities however, Cruise broke down, went
    to the only Nathan's Famous in Texahoma, and consumed three pounds of hot dogs. ;

    While leaving Nathan's, Cruise saw his friend Angelina Smith. He waved at her and said, "I ate
    too many wieners." Smith then pulled a gun out of her purse and shouted, "This one's for you
    Mr. Anderson!" ;

    Terrified, Cruise dived through the window of a closed gun store. The owner of the store, who
    was standing behind the counter at the time, told investigators that Cruise grabbed a gun off the
    counter, stepped out, aimed at Smith, and fired off six shots. ;

    Smith dodged all of the bullets. One bullet, however, hit and killed a Girl Scout standing behind
    Smith. Another bullet ricocheted off a wall, bounced off a metal pole, and lodged itself in the
    bagel of a sassy passing bassist. The bassist would later inadvertently eat the bullet and die of
    lead poisoning. ;

    After Cruise fired the shots, both Cruise and Smith were both tackled by bystanders and arrested.
    During her interrogation, Smith said that she thought Cruise looked like Tom Anderson, the man
    suspected of murdering her son a week earlier. Anderson has been on the run from police but had
    been calling Smith on the phone every night since the murder to taunt her. He was last sighted
    near Nathan's Famous. When she saw Cruise / Anderson, she believed that he was giving her the
    finger and saying, "Neener neener neener." Enraged, she pulled out her gun and pointed it at him.
    Although the gun was not loaded, Smith said that she thought it was. When asked if she intended
    to pull the trigger, she said, "I don't know. I was still thinking about it." ;

    Dave B. Oppy, a reasonable man standing next to Smith, thinks that Cruise looked absolutely
    nothing like Anderson. ;

    You are a clerk to the District Attorney. Write a memo to the DA, analyzing Cruise's and
    Smith's possible criminal liability and possible defenses. Recommend which charges, if any,
    should be filed and explain why. Include, as part of your recommendation, your views of the
    most appropriate disposition of the case in light of the actors' conduct, the harm caused, and
    the purposes served by any prosecution. Note that excerpts from some Texahoma statutes are
    attached. ;
    -----
    The exam becomes gibberish. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny notices the words are beginning to pool around her. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny begins to drown in words. Her single desperate black paw juts out of the sea of words. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit grabs her paw. ;
