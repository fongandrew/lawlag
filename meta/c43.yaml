    <p><b><date></b>. If you've ever done anything remotely helpful for Barack Obama or the Democrats, you've probably been barraged with mail, both of the electronic and the "snail" sort, explaining <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/patientsbillofrights/">what health care reform means for you</a>. I already wrote an earlier strip that <a href="28.html">touched on whether the "mandate" was constitutional</a>. The pre-existing condition reforms aren't that closely tied to law school or legal whatnot, but I felt Brown Rabbit was long overdue for some physical injury.  So here you go.</p>
  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit is standing on the sidewalk next to a tree. ;
    He is about to cross the road. Why does the rabbit want to cross the road? We may never know. ;

                                    We're calling to tell you that
                                    we've terminated your policy. ;
    Brown Rabbit: What, why? ;
    Faceless Bureaucrat (on phone): Failure to disclose a
                                    pre-existing condition. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: I thought you can't discriminate based
                  on pre-existing conditions anymore. ;
    Faceless Bureaucrat (on phone): Normally we can't. ;
    Faceless Bureaucrat (on phone): But there's an exception

                                    exceptionally bad luck. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Come again? ;

    Faceless Bureaucrat (on phone): You have a life-threatening
                                    injury nearly every week. ;
    Faceless Bureaucrat (on phone): Seriously, do
                                    you stand in
                                    the middle of
                                    the freeway
                                    for a living or
                                    something? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Nonsense! I'll have
                  you know that I'm
                  standing in the middle
                  of a boulevard, not a-- ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit is caught like a deer in headlights. Literally. Except he's a rabbit, not a dear. ;

    Faceless Bureaucrat (off-screen): Congratulations! You've been
                                      approved for auto insurance! ;
