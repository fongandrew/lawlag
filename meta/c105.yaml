  alt: The way you pull the trigger is to call up the other party and yell 'BOOM HEADSHOT'.
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. This is why summer associates don't talk to to clients.</p>
    <p>I founded a startup once -- way back when. It's no longer in business, partly  because we had no idea what we were doing. We'd get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_sheet">term sheet</a> with phrases like <a href="http://www.startupcompanylawyer.com/2007/07/11/what-are-redemption-rights/">"redemption"</a>, <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp">"vesting"</a>, and <a href="http://www.mbbp.com/resources/business/double_trigger.html">"double trigger"</a>, and the image that popped into my mind was a dual wielding antihero in a sweater vest seeking atonement for his sins. We said yes to everything, because antiheros in sweater vests are awesome.</p>
    <p>I would also like to reiterate that every page on this site includes the phrase: "Tort Bunnies should not be taken seriously."</p>
  transcript: |
    Client (phone): Hey, my investor's insisting upon
                    double trigger stock acceleration.
                    Do you know what that is? ;
    Negligent Lop: It's a way to screw
                   you over my friend. ;
    Client (phone): What, seriously? ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: Yeah, it's complicated, but imagine
                   there's a two-triggered gun pointed
                   at your head. You have one trigger.
                   Your investor owns the other. ;
    Negligent Lop: Now your investor might say this
                   is fine, because the gun won't fire
                   unless both triggers are pulled. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: But why would you ever want a gun
                   pointed at your head?! What if your
                   investor reaches over and pulls your
                   trigger when you're not looking? ;
    Negligent Lop: Then it's boom! Head shot. ;
    -----
    Client (phone): Wow, that's messed up. I'm gonna
                    tell this guy to f*** off. Thanks dude. ;
    Negligent Lop: Sure thing! ;
    Click! ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop dials another number. ;
    beep beep boop beep ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Brown Rabbit speaking. ;
    Negligent Lop (phone): Hey Brown, it's me. Do you
                           know what double trigger
                           stock acceleration is? ;
