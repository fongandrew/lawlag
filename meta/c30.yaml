  description: Brown Rabbit attempts to make a rape joke.
  transcript: |
    Professor (off-screen): And that's how the standard for
                            rape has evolved over the past
                            century. Any questions? ;
    Brown Rabbit grins and waves his paw enthusiastically. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny whacks Brown Rabbit. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit (weakly): What was that for? ;
    Tort Bunny: I'm sorry. You didn't say no
                to being hit in the face, so I
                thought you wanted it. ;
