  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. It's that time of year again.</p>
    <p>Quick rant: As 1Ls are well aware, <a href="http://www.nalp.org/fulltextofnalpprinciplesandstandards">NALP forbid employers from interviewing or offering jobs to 1Ls before December 1st.</a> The flipside to that is there's this mad rush on December 1st to send everything out, especially for judicial externships. Unfortunately, this also tends to coincide with the beginning of exams and the due dates for papers, memos, and other important school stuff. I really don't see why they can't push the December 1st date to February 1st. That would permit 1Ls to focus on their exams without the spectre of job hunting hanging over their heads. They'd have all of winter break to prepare their applications, and they'd probably have grades by then too. I mean, is there a reason why judges feel a need to fill their extern positions by the end of the year?</p>
