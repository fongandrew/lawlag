  alt: Intentional infliction of emotional distress!
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. A Harvard-educated Asian-American doing well in basketball? I suppose that could cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress">a reasonable person to exclaim "Outrageous!"</a>. Unfortunately, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_risk">assumption of risk</a> or not, tort plaintiffs rarely recover damages for the infliction of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/11/jeremy-lin-knicks-win-fifth-straight_n_1271120.html">Linsanity</a>.</p>
    <p>I'd suggest that we create a sport centered entirely around tortious activities. But the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE">WWE</a> beat me to it.</p>
