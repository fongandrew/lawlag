  alt: Yes, that is a very slow moving asteroid.
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. If some of the characters in panel six don't make sense to you, you clearly haven't read every single Tort Bunnies ever. Or your memory sucks.</p>
    <p>Also, if this arc seems familiar, it may be because of <a href="http://<domain>/93.html">a previous arc here.</a></p>
  transcript: |
    * type type type *;
    Tort Bunny types furiously on her laptop during the bar exam. ;
    Smoke beings to rise from the machine. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit and Negligent Lop are on a hill,
    where we left them at the end of the last comic. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny's laptop bursts into flames. Panic! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit and Negligent Lop get some company. ;
    Among the visitors, we have the egg-carrying White Rabbit,
    from the background of comic #46,
    François le Duc (also introduced in #46),
    the Canadian Quebecois goose from #120,
    the yellow bunny (occasionally mistaken for Pikachu) that
    often appears in the background as a 
    barista in a coffee shop (for example, see #53),
    the evil sandwich (sammich) judge from #37,
    and a random greyish purplish bunny that occasionally
    appears in the background of classroom scenes. ;
    The yellow rabbit has a beer and does a "cheers" motion with Negligent Lop. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny has given up her laptop and is now writing our her exam by hand (paw). ;
    She doesn't look happy. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit and Negligent Lop's little gathering has turned into a full-on party. ;
    Among the (somewhat implausible) appearances in left-to-right,
    top-to-bottom fashion (more or less),
    we have Professor Teddy from Harvard (#124) pointing and laughing
    at the hatless Professor Hobbes (introduced in #78),
    whose characteristic black and orange hat is being tried on by Negligent Lop,
    the brown horse from #131 looking at the unicorn from #86,
    James Madison (#142),
    the young orange bow-wearing bunny that Tort Bunny advises in #91,
    the children Tort Bunny reads The Hobbit to in #150,
    Brown Rabbit's ex holding a Chemerinsky book (see #69),
    the taco-eating rapping armadillo from #162 lending Brown Rabbit a microphone,
    the redneck hick from #85,
    a random charcoal black rabbit used in classroom background scenes,
    Kobe Bryant, Jeremy Lin (now sporting a Rockets jersey), and Pau Gasol (see #145),
    the tree / ent from #75,
    the CoffeeTron 3000 from #103,
    the legal dinosaur from #125,
    Chris and Cara Sandberg (#143, #157) conversing with
    Congressrabbit McDickerson (introduced in #104),
    and the ghost of Mimi Vuvu (introduced in #68)
    talking to James Meowreth
    (the business cat in #130 who may have been responsible for Vuvu's demise). ;
    -----
    An exhausted Tort Bunny leaves the test center ... ;
    -----
    ... only to see the asteroid descending through earth's atmosphere. ;
    Yes, it's still roughly in the same near-the-ground spot we left it in #173. ;
    -----
    Close-up of Tort Bunny's angry eyes. ;
    -----
    A flash of pink streaks towards the asteroid. ;
    -----
    Professor Hobbes, Negligent Lop, Brown Rabbit, François le Duc,
    and assorted background rabbits mentioned earlier look up towards the sky. 
    -----
    Superbunny (introduced in #13) is streaking through the sky towards the asteroid! ;
    Note that based on the angle at which Superbunny approached the asteroid in the
    previous panel, she's technically flying at a downward angle. That said, it looks
    weird to depict her flight that way, so in the image, she's flying upward and the
    sky in the background is flipped upside down.
    Suspense! To be continued in the next comic! ;
