  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. So I think all the 1Ls should know what battery is at this point. If not, well, kicking someone between the legs is battery. Just trust me on that.</p>
    <p>One of the great things about being a 2L is that you can take all the classes you want. The bad part is that you really can't. Between interviews and all of the activities that you "voluntarily" signed up to do, a full load of classes is near impossible for most 2Ls. And heaven help you if you're working at a real job of any sort.</p>

    Negligent Lop: So what classes are you inflicting
                   upon yourself this semester? ;
    Brown Rabbit: I'm taking evidence, corporations
                  carrot law, and death and taxes. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Oh, and a writing workshop too. ;

    Negligent Lop: And doing an unholy
                   number of interviews
                   over the next month? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Well, of course. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: I think that you should
                   consider dropping a class. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I drop nothing. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I AM INVINCIBLE! ;
    -----

    -----
    BATTERY! ;
    Tort Bunny kicks Brown Rabbit between the legs. ;
