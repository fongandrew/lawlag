    <p><b><date></b>. Yes, law school is just like middle school. Also, if you don't get the last three panels, see <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Dudley_and_Stephens">R. v. Dudley and Stephens</a></i>, [1884] 14 QBD 273 DC, in which defendant shipwrecked sailors were convicted of murder for killing and eating their cabin boy to stay alive. See also <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/bloodninja">"robe and wizard hat"</a> (warning: actual lewd language, not just innuendo).</p>
    <p>Also, I don't remember exactly who asked for this comic, but well, you asked for it.</p>

  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: More legal history from the 1800s?
                  Why do we have to learn this? ;
    Tort Bunny: Well, I think it's because,
                you know, the law grew
                in fits and spurts. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: I mean, it's not like Lady Justice
                laid down the law somewhere
                and said, "Come and get it!" ;
    Tort Bunny: There's a process, and you can't just
                blow it off, because to understand
                what lies in front of you, you must
                know what stands behind you. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Past, present, and future ;
    Tort Bunny: The ménage à trois
                of legal scholarship. ;
    Tort Bunny: Yet the law is about more
                than learned hands guiding
                the thrust of history. ;
    Tort Bunny: The rules that bind us today were
                erected by real people pushing
                against hard problems. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: To get a firm grasp on where these
                folks were coming from, you have
                to be up for a little role playing. ;
    Tort Bunny: Put on your robe and wizard
                hat and imagine what those
                seamen felt, stranded at sea
                with naught but a cabin boy! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: A strapping young lad of a cabin boy 
                tanning beneath the summer sun. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Mmmm ... cabin boy. ;
    Brown Rabbit slowly backs away. ;
