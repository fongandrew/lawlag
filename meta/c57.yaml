  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. In case, you couldn't tell, this is parodying scenes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Network">The Social Network</a>. If you're too lazy / cheap / busy / tired / disdainful to watch it, you can get the short version via <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OUHupfqws">this trailer</a> or the much longer version by reading <a href="http://wiscreenwritersforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Social-Network-The-by-Aaron-Sorkin-May-28-2009.pdf">the script</a> (PDF). It's a good movie, and you can see my thoughts about it on <a href="http://andrewfong.com/blog/2010/10/10/harvard-and-the-social-network/">my infrequently-updated blog</a>.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, this episode has a few things that need explaining for my non-law school reading friends (why are you reading this again?):</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_review">Law Review</a> at just about any school is exclusive. Not so fun. But it does lead to a better life.</p>
    <p>The <i>idea</i> for a webcomic about rabbits (and a duck) in law school is not copyrightable, since copyright protects expression, not ideas. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §&#160;102(b) (2006). Nor is it patentable (probably) as it's not a "useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter." <i>See</i> 35 U.S.C. §&#160;101 (2006). Moreover, there's prior art. While I may have been the first to use rabbits and a duck, I didn't make the first <a href="http://legeeke.com/">law school webcomic</a>.</p>
    <p>Boalt Law no longer exists. It is now called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UC_Berkeley_School_of_Law">the UC Berkeley School of Law</a> or something like that. I think I may have established that the rabbits went to some other law school at some point. Oh well, continuity error. Whoops.</p>
    <p>U.S. federal courts have limited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_jurisdiction">subject-matter jurisdiction</a> and can only hear cases involving federal questions or complaints where a citizen in one state sues a citizen in another state over an amount greater than $25,000. In this case, Brown Rabbit would deny that there is any federal question (assuming Negligent Lop didn't bring a copyright or patent claim -- and it'd be silly if he did). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §&#160;1331 (2006). He would also insist that the amount in controversy was less than $75,000 (trust me, Tort Bunnies is currently not raking in the dough) and that both he and Negligent Lop were in the same state (California I guess). <i>See id.</i> §&#160;1332.</p>
    <p>Also, no, Brown Rabbit is not meant to resemble me in any way. He's acting more like a Mark Zuckerbunny in this comic.</p>
  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: I need to do something
                  to get the attention of
                  the Law Review. ;
    Purple Bunny: Why? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Because it's exclusive.
                  And fun. And it leads
                  to a better life. ;
    Purple Bunny: I should go study now. ;
    Brown Rabbit: You don't need to study.
                  You go to business school. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: People want to share something that
                  pokes fun at law school, so why not
                  make a webcomic that offers that?
                  I'm talking about reducing the entire
                  law school experience to a bunch of
                  talking cartoon rabbits! ;
    Negligent Lop: It needs a duck too. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Um ... ok. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: You stole our webcomic idea! ;
    Brown Rabbit: You have no property right in
                  your idea! It was neither 
                  copyrightable nor patentable! ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: He violated California state law!
                   He violated federal law! And by
                   the way, he violated Boalt Law. ;
    Tort Bunny: There's no such
                thing as Boalt Law. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: We're suing you in federal court! ;
    Brown Rabbit: And I move to dismiss for lack
                  of subject-matter jurisdiction. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: You're not an asshole Brown Rabbit. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Thanks! ;
    Tort Bunny: But you try to be,
                so I'm kicking you
                in the balls anyway. ;
