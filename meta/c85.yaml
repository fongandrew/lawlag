  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: No no no! Valuing diversity in the
                  law is not "reverse discrimination"! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: I grew up in a poor minority
                  inner-city neighborhood
                  plagued by gun violence. ;
    Brown Rabbit: My best friend was a transgender 
                  Marxist immigrant denied asylum
                  after police pulled her over for
                  driving-while-black and framed
                  her for distributing crack cocaine. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: To us, the law isn't blind or neutral.
                  It's how the wealthy elite perpetuate
                  existing power structures. ;
    Brown Rabbit: By diversifying the practioners
                  of law, we offer minorities a
                  chance to speak truth to power. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Saying that the status quo is fair and
                  that it's the minorities who are racist
                  is simply an act of rhetorical jujitsu ... ;
    Brown Rabbit: .... an attempt by corporate fat-cats to
                  win support from pig-ignorant Bible-
                  thumping, gun-toting, cousin-loving... ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: ... redneck hicks. ;
    -----
    A white rabbit wearing a trucker cap and blue overalls stands across from Brown Rabbit. ;
    Southern Bunny: Don't make me gut you boy. ;
