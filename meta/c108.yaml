  transcript: |
    Negligent Lop: Thank you for coming Mr. Anderson.
                   I'm hoping to finish this deposition
                   early, so let's just get formalites
                   out of the way. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT STEAL
                   MY CLIENT'S TRADE SECRETS? ;
    -----
    Mr. Anderson (off-panel): Yes, yes I did. What are
                              you going to do about it? ;
    Negligent Lop: I dunno actually. My entire
                   line of questioning depended
                   on you answering "no". ;
