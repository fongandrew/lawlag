  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. First mid-week update! It''s a short one in response to
    a request, but this is exactly what I had in mind when I added the "and whenever
    I feel like it" to the update schedule -- longer strips for Mondays and random
    quick responses when I can. Thanks Hilda.</p>

    <p>If you don''t get the joke, you might want to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebook">The
    Bluebook</a>. And if you still don''t get it, well, sorry.</p>

    <p>Somewhat ironically, I''ve officially renamed the comic from "Lawless Lagomorphs"
    to "Tort Bunnies" despite the fact that this comic has neither a tort nor a bunny
    (not directly anyway -- free carrot to the first person to find my hidden bunny
    reference!). Although not all of the comics involve a tort, most of the people
    I''ve talked to refer to it as "Tort Bunnies" and have a hard time remembering
    "Lawless Lagomorphs" or "LawLag", so I might as well make "Tort Bunnies" the official
    moniker.</p>

  transcript: 'In the present case, plaintiff rabbit contracted with defendant

    bunny to not commit a tort for a year. Id. One week later,

    defendant proceeded to organize a knife throwing competition

    aboard a moving train that she operated. Id. Plaintiff sued for

    breach as such a competition was more likely than not to cause

    a tort, e.g. the negligent infliction of emotional distress. Id.

    Although injuries sustained by competitive knife throwing

    would be barred by assumption of risk, courts generally hold

    that common carriers have a special relationship with their

    clients. That''s what she said. However, the court will not order

    defendant''s specific performance because the contract was

    formed without consideration. See id. Without a contract, there

    can be no breach. Id. However, the plaintiff counters that

    under promissory estoppel, he may still recover. ;
