  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit and Tort Bunny head towards a tornado in a pickup truck. ;
    Tort Bunny: There's the tornado! Turn
                left and get ahead of it! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Stop here and help
                me with this box. ;
    -----
    The two unload a cardbox box full of flyers. ;
    Tort Bunny: If we're lucky, the storm
                will pass right over here
                and pick up these flyers. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Wait, flyers? ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit reads one of the flyers in the box. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Shoddy construction? Medical
                  malpractice? Insurance companies
                  dragging their feet? Call now and
                  we'll make someone pay. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Call Tortious "The Hammer" Bunny today. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Yeah, the ABA says we can't directly
                solicit tornado victims for business. ;
    Tort Bunny: But there's no rule against having
                the tornado do the soliciting for you! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: This is wrong. ;
    Tort Bunny: But it's ethical! ;
