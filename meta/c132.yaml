  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/706.html">Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act</a> allows courts to overturn decisions by government agencies that are arbitrary or capricious. Courts try to avoid looking at the substance of a regulation and instead review the process by which a decision was made. <i>See <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=759595841034114890">Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</a></i>, 463 U.S. 29 (1983). Commentators refer to this as a "hard look" review -- that is, did the agencies take a "hard look" at the underlying facts and policy? If not, a court may (with some exceptions) set aside the agency's decision as arbitrary and capricious.</p>

  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit points to a chart. ;
    Brown Rabbit: As this unlabeled chart shows,
                  the nutritional value of carrots
                  will drastically decline once
                  the proposed rule takes effect. ;
    -----
    Commissioner McDickerson: Thank you Mr. Rabbit. As
                              everyone knows, nutritious
                              is the opposite of delicious. ;
    Commissioner McDickerson: Therefore, I assume you support
                              our delicious proposed rule. ;
    Superbunny: Not so fast Administrator! ;
    -----
    Commissioner McDickerson: I'm a Commissioner. ;
    Superbunny: Whatever. ;
    Superbunny: The law demands we take a
                hard look at the data before
                we finalize our rule. ;
    -----
    Superbunny gives Brown Rabbit and his chart a hard look, complete with red laser eye. ;
    -----
    FWOOSH. ;
    -----
    The chart has a burning hole, and Brown Rabbit runs around aflame. ;
    Commissioner McDickerson: That seemed excessive. ;
    Superbunny: Fear my look!
                Fear it hard! ;
