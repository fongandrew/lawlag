  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Yup, it's about that time of the year again, when half the school starts asking the other half for votes. The first person to run on a campaign slogan of "I poop rainbows" and send me proof gets a free Tort Bunnies t-shirt.</p>
    <p>Speaking of voting, my friend <a href="http://www.dashkwiatkowski.com/">Dash</a> is representing Cal in the National College Comedy Competition. <a href="http://www.rooftopcomedy.com/college/standup/schools/Cal">Go vote for him this Thursday!</a> A vote for Dash Kwiatkowski is a vote for freedom. And unicorns.</p>
    <p>Oh, and a shout-out to Jonas, Mike, and just about everyone else in <a href="http://btlj.org">BTLJ</a>.</p>
