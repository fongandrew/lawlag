  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: If you add up all the words we've
                  written this semester -- outlines,
                  briefs, notes, memos, etcetera ... ;
    Brown Rabbit: ... we've written enough to fill
                  a novel in the Twilight series. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Think about it. Instead of
                  studying law, we could've
                  earned millions writing
                  about sexy, sexy vampires. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: You read Twilight?
    Brown Rabbit: Just to count the words. ;
