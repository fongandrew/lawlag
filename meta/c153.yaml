  transcript: |
    Negligent Lop is hovering in the air, Dumbo-style.
    Negligent Lop: Behold! Through sheer
                   force of will, I can flap
                   my ears hard enough
                   to hover in the air! ;
    Brown Rabbit: Amazing! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: The power of the mind
                  can conquer anything. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: You know, maybe I
                  could will myself out
                  of student debt! ;
    Negligent Lop: Psshhh, when PIGS fly. ;
