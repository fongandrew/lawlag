    Brown Rabbit: And so the originalist rationale cited
                  by the court is really an attempt to

    Professor Cal V. Hobbes: It's a powerful idea Mr. Rabbit.
                             And one likely lost upon your

    Brown Rabbit grins. ;
    Tort Bunny glares. ;
    Professor Cal V. Hobbes: What Mr. Rabbit is saying is that the
                             struggle over a scarce supply of carrots

    Professor Cal V. Hobbes: ... nasty, brutish, and short. ;
    -----
    Professor Cal V. Hobbes: And therefore-- ;
    Brown Rabbit: Wait, what? That's the exact
                  opposite of what I was saying. ;
    -----
    Professor Hobbes lets the silence hang over the class for a moment. ;

    Professor Cal V. Hobbes: Mr. Rabbit, you are an idiot. ;
