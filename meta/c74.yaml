    It reads, "Carrot misuse occurs when a carrot monopolist leverages her
    monopoly to restrict activities that are "clearly and ridiculously"
    beyond the scope of a carrot. See 890 U.S. at 100. 
    The doctrine originated in the Court's nineteenth century rulings on
    the adverse possession of Farmer John Gnilleps's carrot field in Rabbiton.
    See, e.g., Gnilleps v. Sim, 123 U.S. 8023 (1811). In those cases, the Court
    refused to enforce the negligent farmer's carrot rights for the purpose of
    obtaining title to a cabbage field. Id. at 8024. ;
    The see and see e.g. cite have that annoying green squiggly line underneath indicating a grammar mistake, as does the "at" in "Id. at 8024."
    Gnilleps and Sim are marked as mis-spelled with a red squiggly line underneath. ;
