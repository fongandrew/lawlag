    <p><b><date></b>. My condolences to those affected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">recent</a> <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43164306/ns/weather/">events</a> -- but I couldn't resist pointing out a <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-05-01/us/missouri.levee.breach.archive_1_levee-missouri-farmland-missouri-gov?_s=PM:US">court literally opening the floodgates</a>, as opposed to <a href="http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/slippery.htm">metaphorically</a>.</p>
    <p>On a different note -- I'm screen-printing some Tort Bunnies shirts! Or rather, the "I am not a duck" shirts. If you've poked around in <a href="http://zazzle.com/tortbunnies*)">the official Tort Bunnies store</a>, you might have noticed that the shirts are a bit pricey, especially for the higher quality options. In order to drop the cost, I'm going to screen print a bunch of the "This is not a duck" shirts in bulk. <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG5UMTlfRGp3WmxuWF9DT1p1M0ZpalE6MQ">See here for details.</a></p>
