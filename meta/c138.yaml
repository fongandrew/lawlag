  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny: Merry Christmas! I
                give the gift of cake! ;
    Negligent Lop: Thanks! It looks delicious! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Well, what'd you get me? ;
    -----
    Frowny face from Tort Bunny. ;
    Hapless grin from Negligent Lop. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: I expended considerable resources
                acquiring this gift in reliance
                upon the implied promise that I
                would receive a gift in return. ;
    Tort Bunny: Principles of equity and 
                good conscience demand
                that you give me stuff! ;

    Brown Rabbit: Hey! Who took my cake? ;
    -----

                   you won't. ;
