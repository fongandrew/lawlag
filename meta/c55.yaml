  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny and Brown Rabbit are at some sort of gathering, a birthday party perhaps. ;
    Brown Rabbit holding a red balloon and wearing a party hat (or maybe a wizard hat). ;
    Brown Rabbit: Well, another arbitrary length
                  of time has passed, but I'm still
                  the same rabbit I was before. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: That's why I think it's important to
                  focus on the here and now rather
                  than on what may or may not come. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Still no job? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Still no job. ;
