  transcript: |
    Professor Hobbes gives a BarBri lecture on Carrot Law. ;
    Professor Hobbes: Make sure you study
                      specific performance
                      of a carrot contract. ;
    Professor Hobbes: 60% of the bar exams over
                      the past 12 years have had
                      an essay question on that. ;
    -----
    Professor Hobbes: And also study parol
                      carrot exceptions. ;
    Professor Hobbes: We haven't had a question
                      on that in over 8 years, so
                      we're long overdue for one. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: What about topics that have occasionally
                  appeared in the last few years but not so
                  frequently as to be on every other exam? ;
    Professor Hobbes (off-panel): Yeah, study those too. ;
