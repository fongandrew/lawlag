    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">6th Amendment</a> guarantees a criminal defendant the right "to confront the witnesses against him," which generally means the right to cross-examine the prosecution's witnesses.</p>
    <p>Can using a laser against someone be battery? I think so. Battery requires "harmful contact." Direct contact isn't required. Indirect contact -- e.g. throwing a ball at someone -- is sufficient. Even fine <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13341405241248455408">particulate matter</a> -- e.g. smoke -- constitutes enough physical contact to be battery. Lasers emit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a>, which are particles<del> with mass</del> (also waves, but whatever). Therefore, you can commit battery by laser vision.</p>
    <p><strong>Update</strong>: Or maybe not -- see Jamie's comment below.</p>
