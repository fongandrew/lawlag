  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: And so a motion to dismiss is proper
                  only if the plaintiff can prove no set
                  of facts to support her claim. ;
    Tort Bunny: What about Iqbal v. Ashcroft? ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Well, that's the exception
                  that proves the rule. ;
    Tort Bunny: Not it isn't. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Come again? ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: No, it is not the exception that proves
                the rule. It's just an exception. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: The only thing it proves is that you're
                trying to refute something you can't
                explain with a misused idiom instead
                of logical reasoning. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Perhaps ... ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: But irregardless, for all intensive
                  purposes, that just begs the
                  question of why you're literally
                  hoeing this formalistic line. ;
    Tort Bunny sputters. ;
    Tort Bunny: No it doesn't--
                You can't--
                That's not-- ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Stop it! ;
    Brown Rabbit: Exactly! ;
    Tort Bunny: Don't make me get stabby. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I know. That's what I was just saying. ;
