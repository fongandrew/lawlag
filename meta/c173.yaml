  transcript: |
    As we scroll down, the image transitions from outer space to a sunny day. ;
    Negligent Lop and Brown Rabbit are sitting an a grassy knoll overlooking the ocean. ;
    Negligent Lop: You're done early. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Didn't see the point in staying. ;
    Negligent Lop: Because the bar exam bears little
                   relation to the actual practice of law? ;
    Brown Rabbit: No, not that. ;
    Negligent Lop: Because law school bears little
                   relation to the bar exam? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Not that either. ;
    Negligent Lop: Because legal fiction bears little relation
                   to the actual problems the world faces? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Not quite. ;
    Negligent Lop: Because an asteroid is about to destroy the
                   planet, so there's no point to anything at all? ;
    Brown Rabbit: No, it's something more than that. Like, do you
                  ever get the impression that we're just two-
                  dimensional snapshots of an indescribably
                  more complex universe, completely divorced
                  from larger currents in space and time? ;
    Negligent Lop: Nope, that'd be out
                   of character for me. ;
    Negligent Lop hands Brown Rabbit a bottle. ;
    Negligent Lop: Drink? ;
