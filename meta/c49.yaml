  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Thanks to Phil for suggesting this comic. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws">LL.M. students</a> attend many of the same classes J.D. students do, but tend to be practicing lawyers from outside the U.S. The clash of legal traditions is often interesting. There is, at any rate, a deep-seated antipathy among American jurists to anything Europeean. See David Sklansky, <i><a href="http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/122/april09/sklansky.pdf">Anti-Inquisitorialism</a></i> [PDF], 122 Harv. L. Rev. 1634 (2008).</p>
    <p>In addition, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">the Seventh Amendment</a>. See also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras">foie gras</a>.</p>
    <p>Another thing: Not that I'm one to talk, but did any of you notice that <a href="http://www.scoutsongs.com/lyrics/proudtobeamerican.html">Lee Greenwood's lyrics</a> are grammatically incorrect?</p>
    <p>Finally, note that I've changed the citation prefix at the bottom of the comic from "cite to" to "cite as:". Apparently, <a href="http://lawprose.org/interviews/supreme_court.php?vid=scalia_part_1&amp;vidtitle=Associate_Justice_Antonin_Scalia_Part_1">Justice Scalia hates "cite to"</a> (jump to 1:40 in the video).</p>
  transcript: |
    Professor Cottontail (off-panel): So the case now goes to a jury to
                                      determine whether the patent is-- ;
    François le Duc: Excuse me Professor, but I do not
                     see why Americans insist upon
                     jury in such technical case. ;
    -----
    François le Duc: For example, in my country,
                     whether duckling is swan or
                     just ugly is hard question for
                     jury. ;
    François le Duc: Many factors must balance. ;
    François le Duc: So we appoint special drake,
                     use science measure ugliness,
                     throw jury out tall window. ;
    -----
    François le Duc: That is metaphor. ;
    Professor Cottontail (off-panel): I, uh -- Ms. Bunny, do you
                                      want to say something? ;
    Tort Bunny: Yes I do. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Unlike you continentals, we Americans
                inherited from the British a common
                law right to a jury trial and a healthy
                distrust of tyrannical governments. ;
    Tort Bunny: The right to a jury in civil cases is what
                keeps activist judges from imposing
                European-style socialism upon us. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: And I'm proud to be an American,
                where at least I know I'm free. ;
    Cue American flag waving in the background. ;
    Tort Bunny: GOD BLESS THE USA! ;
    -----
    François le Duc: This is same America
                     that approve torture? ;
    Tort Bunny: This is same America that's gonna shove a 
                tube down your throat and stuff you until
                your liver explodes if you don't shut up. ;
    Tort Bunny: That is not metaphor. ;
