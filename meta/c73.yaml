  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. That concludes our Christmas arc. For those just joining us, this story arc <a href="http://<domain>/67.html">started here</a>. And now back to our normal once-a-week update schedule.</p>
    <p>I'd also like to remind everyone that, cameos notwithstanding, the rabbits are fictional characters and that their views and language do not necessarily represent that of any actual person.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Alex and Sarah for the idea of doing a holiday-themed comic.</p>
    <p>Merry Christmas, and Happy New Year!</p>
    <!-- For the curious, here's the non-censored version of Tort Bunny's rant: You're a real asshole Brown Rabbit. I've been waiting here five days for you to fucking snap out of your fucking coma. But fuck me and my mental well-being. Oh, I don't have my own jackass family to see over the motherfucking holidays. I'd much rather dick around with some fucking gun-running gun-bunny who cockslapped himself off a motherfucking shit-high fuck-scraper, asstard he is. Who then motherfucking shits atop the fuck-my-time continuum, pissing for the fuck-in-a-cup assfucker award like a dick-ass ghost fucking tits in my fucktarded cereal, as if I'd fucking love shitting cow-balls out my ass guessing what cuntsucking you've been up to in tittyfucking coma-world. So fuck me God, if you ever pull this fucking cock-shit again and live, I will fucking drown you in a puddle of shit.
