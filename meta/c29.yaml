    <p><b><date></b>. This weekend was admit weekend, when all of Boalt's newly admitted students, a/k/a admits, 0Ls, and Zeros, showed up to visit, and we current students did our best to convince them that if they <i>must</i> go to law school, Boalt was the least insane place to go. Some alcohol may have been necessary.</p>

  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit: The newly admitted students are here! ;
    Negligent Lop: Bright-eyed bushy-tailed idealists
                   ready to change the world! ;
    Brown Rabbit: Future advocates for
                  the public interest! ;
    Negligent Lop: Leaders and policymakers
                   for the next generation! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Fragile little minds to warp and twist! ;
    Negligent Lop: Plump juicy vessels of youthful
                   energy with which to rejuvenate
                   my withered soul! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit raises an eyebrow -- his left one. ;
    Negligent Lop grins. ;
    -----
    A bushy-tailed admit pops up. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Oh, hello. ;
    Bouncy Bun-Bun: Hi! I'm an admit, and I'm
                    hoping you could answer
                    a question for me. ;
    -----
    Bouncy Bun-Bun: I need to get a firm job for my 1L
                    summer to keep the interest on my
                    undergrad loans from dessicating
                    my financial corpse. ;
    Bouncy Bun-Bun: Given the current economy,
                    should I focus on asbestos
                    litigation or estate planning? ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop leans in with a bottle in his paw. ;
    Negligent Lop: Drink. Now. ;
