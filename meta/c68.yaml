  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Hey, so it turns out <a href="http://<domain>/67.html">last week's comic</a> was the beginning of an arc! Who knew? Silly question. I did of course. Anyhow, check back tomorrow for more!</p>
    <p>Oh yes, one more thing: This strip is for charity. Mimi Vu's cameo is courtesy of her winning bid at this year's Berkeley Law Foundation auction.</p>

    Brown Rabbit (thinking): Hmmm ... I appear to be falling. ;
    A Mysterious Voice (off-panel): Hello. ;
    -----
    An erie female bunny appears. ;
    Chained to her feet are two heavy balls with the letter "D" engraved upon them. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Oh hello. ;
    Ghost: I'm here to save you. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: From falling? You don't
                  seem particularly well-
                  equipped to do that. ;
    Ghost: If you refer to these
           chains, these are the
           ones I built in life. ;
    -----
    Ghost: I am the ghost of Mimi Vuvu,
           and I have been condemned
           by my gunnery to bear the
           heavy burdens of debt and
           drudgery for all eternity. ;
    Ghost: I seek to save you from a similar fate. ;
    -----
    . . .
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Bah! Humbug! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Although the ground is approaching
                  quickly. I could use a hand right now. ;
    Ghost of Mimi Vuvu: In that case, I call upon ... ;
    -----
    Ghost of Mimi Vuvu: ... THE GHOST OF
                        LAW SCHOOL PAST! ;
    -----
    The Ghost of Law School Past and Brown Rabbit now appear as ethereal figures in a coffee shop. ;
    The Ghost of Law School Past looks somewhat like Mimi Vuvu wearing a white sheet. ;
    Brown Rabbit: You look familiar. ;
    The Ghost of Law School Past: I need the hours. ;
