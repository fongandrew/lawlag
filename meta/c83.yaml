  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I'ma let you finish, but the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvkKX035484"> Ghostbusters music video by Ray Parker Jr.</a> is one of the best videos of all time! Of all time!</p>
    <p>For extra credit, interpret above video as commentary on race relations in America during the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Additional commentary, in no particular order:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2052585/Ghostbusters-Theme---Piano-Sheet-Music">I used the sheet music here</a>. I omitted the rests in my notation, among other things, because the Ghostbusters never rest.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.law.berkeley.edu/10572.htm">My law school is haunted.</a></li>
    <li>For those who don't recognize the ghost, she appeared during the <a href="http://<domain>/68.html"> Tort Bunnies Christmas special</a>.</li>
    <li>A tip of the hat to <a href="http://drmcninja.com">Dr. McNinja</a> and <a href="http://drmcninja.com/archives/comic/20p67">this page in particular</a>.</li>
    <li>They're making a <a href="http://collider.com/bill-murray-talks-ghostbusters-3-on-letterman/17978/">third Ghostbusters movie</a>!</li>
