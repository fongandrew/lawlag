  description: Lucy gets good news. Sort of.

  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Just kidding about the previous comic being the last one before I take a break. This one is. Good luck to everyone waiting to hear back about offers!</p>
    <p>In case anyone is interested in making their own Tort Bunnies, I've also taken the liberty
    of posting <a href="http://<domain>/source/">the "source code" for each Tort Bunnies comic.</a> Each comic is an SVG file created
    in <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (which is free to use). I don't feel like posting a how-to just yet, but feel free to dabble around. And if you're interested,
    shoot me an e-mail and I'll explain how to go about editing stuff.</p>
