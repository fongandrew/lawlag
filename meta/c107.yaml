  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)">Depositions</a> would go by more quickly if attorneys could spike the coffee with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_thiopental#Truth_serum">sodium pentothal</a>.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=depose">The etymology of "depose"</a> comes from "de" (down) and pose (put, place), which makes sense when you think of "depose" in the political sense (e.g. depose a dictator). Anyhow, I think depositions would be a lot more fun if we started calling them "throw downs".</p>

    Negligent Lop: Thank you for coming Mr. Anderson.
                   I'm hoping to finish this deposition
                   early, so let's just get formalites
                   out of the way. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT STEAL
                   MY CLIENT'S TRADE SECRETS? ;
    -----
    Mr. Anderson (off-panel): Um ... no, I did not. ;
    Negligent Lop: Huh ... this is going to take
                   longer than I anticipated. ;
