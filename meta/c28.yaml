Also, I think law school exams encourage more breadth than depth -- it's relatively hard for a professor to objectively say "student X's analysis is better than student Y's" but relatively easy to say "student X addressed more of my bullet points than did student Y." As a result, there's an incentive in law school to reduce complex issues down to assortments of loosely related buzzwords.</p>
    <p>Come to think of it, there's an incentive to do that in politics too.</p>
