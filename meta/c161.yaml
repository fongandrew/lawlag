  alt: Tort Bunny should just insist the entire conversation was a settlement negotiation.
  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. Whoever wrote the bar exam apparently thinks it's important that we know the difference between hearsay exemptions (not hearsay) and exceptions (hearsay, but still admissible). That's like asking a vegetarian what dipping sauce they'd like with their chicken nuggets.</p>
  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny: Ha, I've stolen your carrot! ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Ha, you've admitted fault! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Ha, you're offering out-of-court
                hearsay for the truth of the matter! ;
    Brown Rabbit: Ha, it's not hearsay because the F.R.E.
                  exempts party opponent admissions! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Ha, there's no federal subject matter
                jurisdiction and we're in a state where
                admissions still count as hearsay. ;
    Brown Rabbit: Ha, this state's evidence rules may
                  not exempt admissions but it still
                  provides an exception to the rule
                  so your admission is admissible! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Well, ha, I still have your carrot. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit: Can I get my carrot back please? ;
    Tort Bunny: No. No, you may not. ;
