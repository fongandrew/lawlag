  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. I confess to occasionally being guilty of this crime too. There have been days where I get "loud" food and only after the first bite realize how much of a problem this will be. Those are the days in which I leave edibles in my mouth for extended periods of time and wish that my saliva would do its thing more quickly.</p>
    <p>This originally was going to be a longer comic about Civil Procedure. It involved a dialogue that went something like this:</p>
    <p><b>Tort Bunny:</b> Excuse me, but your crunching is quite loud.<br />
       <b>Brown Rabbit:</b> Complaint DISMISSED for failure to state a claim.<br />
       <b>Tort Bunny:</b> But we're in class!<br />
       <b>Brown Rabbit:</b> Complaint DISMISSED with PREJUDICE.</p>
    <p>If you didn't get that, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleading#Notice_pleading">pleading</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_(legal_procedure)">prejudice</a>.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, I couldn't get things to flow to my satisfaction, so instead, you get MUNCH-CRUNCH-PUNCH.</p>
