  notes: "<p><b><date></b>. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_against_perpetuities\"\
    >Rule Against Perpetuities</a> is best described as a shitshow.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\
    \  The complaint, as we have seen, alleges that defendant drafted the will in\
    \ such a manner that the trust was invalid because it violated the rules relating\
    \ to perpetuities and restraints on alienation. These closely akin subjects have\
    \ long perplexed the courts and the bar. Professor Gray, a leading authority in\
    \ the field, stated: \"There is something in the subject which seems to facilitate\
    \ error. Perhaps it is because the mode of reasoning is unlike that with which\
    \ lawyers are most familiar. . . . A long list might be formed of the demonstrable\
    \ blunders with regard to its questions made by eminent men, blunders which they\
    \ themselves have been sometimes the first to acknowledge; and there are few lawyers\
    \ of any practice in drawing wills and settlements who have not at some time either\
    \ fallen into the net which the Rule spreads for the unwary, or at least shuddered\
    \ to think how narrowly they have escaped it.\" (Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities\
    \ (4th ed. 1942) p. xi; see also Leach, Perpetuities Legislation (1954) 67 Harv.L.Rev.\
    \ 1349 [describing the rule as a \"technicality-ridden legal nightmare\" and a\
    \ \"dangerous instrumentality in the hands of most members of the bar\"].) Of\
    \ the California law on perpetuities and restraints it has been said that few,\
    \ if any, areas of the law have been fraught with more confusion or concealed\
    \ more traps for the unwary draftsman; that members of the bar, probate courts,\
    \ and title insurance companies make errors in these matters; that the code provisions\
    \ adopted in 1872 created a situation worse than if the matter had been left to\
    \ the common law, and that the legislation adopted in 1951 (under which the will\
    \ involved here was drawn), despite the best of intentions, added further complexities.\
    \ (See 38 Cal.Jur.2d 443; Coil, Perpetuities and Restraints; A Needed Reform (1955)\
    \ 30 State Bar J. 87, 88-90.)\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><i><a href=\"http://lawschoolhaiku.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/lucas-v-hamm/\"\
