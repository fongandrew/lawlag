  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. My friend Kelly refers to this sort of activity as "schmoo-schmoo". I think it's appropriate. Schmoozing sounds like a duplicitous activity that facilitates the making of deals, the sharing of secrets, and the greasing of squeaky wheels. Many law students aspire to schmooze. We are outsiders. <a href="http://<domain>/52.html">We want in.</a> And we often fail.</p>
    <p>Instead, we get schmoo-schmoo, which sounds like an awkward make-out session preceded by inane conversation about kittens.</p>
