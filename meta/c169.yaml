  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. For the uninitiated, this is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWS8Mg-JWSg">Monty Python</a> reference.</p>
    <p>I don't know how other states do this, but California tests on both the California rules and majority or federal rules for civil procedure, professional responsibility, and evidence. If you're a 2L or 3L, I recommend learning at least the majority or federal rules before you start studying for the bar. It's a lot easier to learn a set of exceptions for the first time than to learn two sets of rules that are similar, but not quite.</p>
