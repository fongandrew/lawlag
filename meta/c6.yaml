  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel#Promissory_estoppel">promissory
    estoppel</a>. This was in response to a prompt by Alyssa. She wanted one for <a
    href="http://www.lawnix.com/cases/feinberg-pfeiffer.html"><i>Feinberg v. Pfeiffer</i></a>,
    322 S.W.2d 163 (Mo. App. 1959), but all I could think about was this generic promissory
    estoppel one.</p>

    <p>If you''re unfamiliar with office chair jousting, see <a href="http://<domain>/4.html#notes">last
    week</a>. Waste assets I do not. Also, this weekend was pretty busy, so that''s
    why you''re only getting one panel and an idea yanked from a previous week''s
    brainstorming.</p>

    <p>You may also have noticed background colors and speech bubbles (rectangles).
    I''m not sure if these will be permanent mainstays -- they''re a little too time-consuming
    for an otherwise hacked together webcomic, but the bubbles were useful for showing
    interrupion.</p>'
