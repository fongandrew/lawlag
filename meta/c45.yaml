    This panel depicts a Facebook page. ;
    Lucy U. : Hi everyone! Is anyone else still trying to figure
              out housing? I'm a little worried about rooming with other
              law students, especially during my 1L year.

    Tort Bunny: Hi Lucy! I can understand where
                you're coming from. Rooming with another
                stressed-out first year doesn't help. But you
                should consider living with a 2L or 3L. They tend
                to be a little more grounded and can offer some
                much needed perspective about law school.

    This panel depicts yet said Facebook page again. ;
    Lucy U.: Hey folks! I heard it was a good idea to get a head
             start on studying -- i.e. before school actually starts. Does
             anyone have any recommendations on which study guides
             I should buy?
