    <p><b><date></b>. There's enough inside baseball in this one to kill a horse, but I'll focus on this one tree in the forest: This comic is about the Internet.</p>
    <p>During my 1L year, I had to write a brief for my Written and Oral Advocacy class that a "place of public accommodation" under the American Disabilities Act did not encompass websites. You can find my thoughts about <a href="http://andrewfong.com/blog/2010/03/24/tort-bunnies-is-now-accessible-to-the-blind/">the public policy implications of that here</a>.</p>
    <p>One of the issues I dealt with in that brief surrounded the use and abuse of metaphors. Sometimes the Internet is a collection of places in cyberspace. Sometimes it's an information superhighway. Sometimes it's a web, sometimes it's a cloud, and, of course, sometimes it's a series of tubes. A judge's choice of metaphors has substantial implications for how she will apply the law. Judges like to say that they're merely applying the law, and that legislatures make the hard policy choices. In practice though, something as simple as thinking of the Internet as a series of tubes instead of as a place has substantial public policy implications.</p>

  transcript: |
    Tort Bunny is moseying along. ;
    In the background, we see a series of tubes from Super Mario Bros. ;
    Tort Bunny: We don't want judges making policy
                because policy is inherently political. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Policy making presents a series of
                Hobson's choices. The straight and
                narrow puts folks between a rock
                and a hard place, so we have to
                sweeten the pot through half-assed
                horse-trading. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: You can't declare that something is
                just. You have to make the sausage.
                The process is messy, but the end
                product is acceptable to the masses.
                And courts should respect that. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny's on a horse.
    -----
    Horse Edwards: I confess I'm a little unnerved by
                   how quickly you went from
                   horse-trading to sausage-making. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: That's why horses don't make policy. ;
