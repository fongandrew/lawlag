  description: Brown Rabbit diagrams a lawsuit.
  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit and Tort Bunny stand in front of a large colorful diagram. ;
    Brown Rabbit has a dry erase marker in his paw. ;
    The diagram is a little too much to describe with text -- so I apologize to the blind, but it
    shows, inter alia: ;
    * Multiple plaintiffs suing multiple defendants on both federal law claims and > $75,000 diversity claims. ;
    * Plaintiff aggregating smaller < $75,000 state law claims claims with other claims federal courts have subject matter jurisdictions ;
    * Parties counter-claiming and cross-claiming against each other ;
    * Defendants impleading third-party defendants ;
    * The I.R.S. and the U.S. Department of Justice bringing federal criminal charges against some of the parties ;
    * Other parties intervening as plaintiffs, defendants, and "other" ;
    * A state raising a constitutional question against the federal government ;
    * A possible class action case ;
    * Overlapping plaintiff and defendant classes ;
    * A future constitutional question waiting to happen between class action plaintiff and defendants ;
    * A malpractice claim and two Rule 11 sanctions, one sua sponte ;
    * Parties suing both the federal and state court as part of an interlocutory appeal ;
    * Mr. Henderson threatening to shoot if those damn lawyers trample over Mrs. Henderson's petunias again ;
    * A state criminal charge by the State Attorney General against Mr. Henderson. ;
    * And in rem actions against 314 pounds of pie. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I think we should settle. ;
    Tort Bunny: I think we should pass this off as
                a Jackson Pollock piece and sell it. ;
