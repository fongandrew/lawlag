  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">The 16th Amendment makes very clear that income taxes are constitutional.</a></p>
    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">14th Amendment</a> does not cover private actors or individuals. It only prevents state actors from discriminating. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Non-discrimination laws covering employers and businesses</a> are actually passed under Congress's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause powers</a>, not its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_power_of_enforcement">14th Amendment powers</a>.</p>
    <p>In a <i>civil suit</i> for battery (i.e. the victim suing you for money, rather than the government trying to throw you in jail), the standard is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Preponderance_of_the_evidence">"preponderance of the evidence"</a>, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Beyond_reasonable_doubt">"beyond a reasonable doubt"</a>.</p>
    <p>You don't have a constitutional right to jury trials for "petty" offenses. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18288918337645155847"><i>Baldwin v. New York</i></a>, 399 U.S. 66 (1970).</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">First Amendment</a> only prevents Congress (and via the 14th Amendment, the states) from limiting freedom of speech. Facebook can ban you for being an ass just fine.</p>
    <p>On a different note, I'd like to share this image of <a href="http://zoopremecourt.org/post/3920966922/thurgood-marshvole-1967-1991">Thurgood Marshvole</a> from <a href="http://zoopremecourt.org/">Zoopreme Court</a>. Is this not amazing? I think it's amazing.</p>
