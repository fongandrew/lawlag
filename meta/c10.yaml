  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. A few things to clear up: (1) Tort Bunny is holding a
    cattle prod connected to a big-ass battery -- these things are hard to draw. (2)
    <a href="9.html">Tort Bunny can be punny</a> if she gets to inflict bodily harm
    in the process. (3) Yes, Tort Bunny just committed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(tort)">battery</a>
    with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)">battery</a>.</p>

    \ ;\nBrown Rabbit: You passed title\n              in this contract. ;\nBrown\
    \ Rabbit points to a scribble on a sheet of paper. ;\nBrown Rabbit: This clause\
    \ here. ;\n-----\nTort Bunny: But that clause is hidden on\n            the back\
    \ of the contract! ;\nBrown Rabbit: Looking only at the front\n              would\
    \ be rather one-sided,\n              don't you think? ;\nTort Bunny: I ... wait,\
    \ what? ;\n-----\nTort Bunny: I'll be right back. ;\nTort Bunny turns around leaves;\n\
    -----\nBrown Rabbit dawdles. ;\n-----\nBrown Rabbit looks alarmed. ;\n-----\n\
    Brown Rabbit is shocked. Literally. ;\n-----\nTort Bunny: I shock your conscience.\n\
    \            I shock it hard.\n"
