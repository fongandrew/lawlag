    <p><b><date></b>. I don't want to comment too much about <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2017887566_trayvonmartinfacts02.html">the specifics of an ongoing criminal investigation</a>. But one silver lining to the Trayvon Martin shooting, unfortunate as it is, is that it's provoked a discussion about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_self-defense#Legal_status_of_self-defense">the right to self-defense</a> and its limits. To what extent do we want ordinary citizens stopping suspected crime, and to what extent do we want them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_retreat">backing off</a> and letting the professionals deal with it? After all, that suspicious-looking dude in a hoody might just be a kid who bought some Skittles.</p>
