  notes: '<p><b><date></b>. Yes, Tort Bunny has feelings too -- depending on where
    this comic falls in the Tort Bunnies timeline, this may be the root of all her
    future tortious conduct. Or maybe she''s just inherently a bad apple. In any case,
    I advise against reading too deeply into this one.</p>

    <p>Also, thanks to Margaret for the prompt. I made this slightly after the Berkeley
    Law Foundation''s annual auction / dance / dress-up-and-drink event, which is
    often described as Boalt''s Law School Prom, although I think the actual "Law
    School Prom" phrase is reserved for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barristers''_Ball">Barristers''
    Ball</a>. In addition, see the <a href="http://www.mexicanbus.net/">Mexican Party
    Bus</a>.</p>

  transcript: "Brown Rabbit hands Tort Bunny a flower resembling a diasy. ;\nTort\
    \ Bunny has a pink bow attached slightly off to her left side,\nthereby disambiguating\
    \ her gender -- or making it more confusing\ndepending on when you hail from.\
    \ ;\nWith that, we've cleared up the ambiguity of Tort Bunny's gender. ;\nOr made\
    \ it more confusing depending on from where you hail. ;\nBrown Rabbit: Tort Bunny,\
    \ will you go\n              to the law school prom\n              with me? ;\n\
    Tort Bunny: That might be fun. ;\nBrown Rabbit: Excellent, let's talk\n      \
    \        liquidated damages. ;\n-----\nNegligent Lop: Or come with me and ride\
    \ my Mexican Party Bus! ;\nTort Bunny looks at the recently arrived Lop. ;\nShe\
    \ is holding the flower in her left paw. ;\nTort Bunny: That would be amazing!\
    \ ;\nTort Bunny is apparently unaware that Mexican Party Buses, while almost always\
    \ epic, are often less than amazing. ;\nBrown Rabbit looks mad, like furrowed\
    \ eyebrows mad. ;\nBrown Rabbit: Scoundrel! You're tortiously interfering\n  \
    \            with a contractual relationship! ;\n-----\nNegligent Lop: Bunny see\
    \ no contract.\n               Bunny breach no contract. ;\nNegligent Lop raises\
    \ his left paw in front of Tort Bunny,\nperhaps to block her sight -- these things\
    \ are hard to\ndecipher since human gestures don't map well to\nstubby rabbit\
    \ paws. ;\nBrown Rabbit: We were about to\n              memorialize it! ;\n-----\n\
    Tort Bunny now has the flower in her left paw. ;\nTort Bunny: Actually, I'm under\
    \ 18.\n            I can void any contract I want. ;\nBrown Rabbit and Negligent\
    \ Lop: You're underage?! ;\nThey both have surprised expressions on their faces.\
    \ ;\nThe two of them normally speak in different font styles,\nso I'm not sure\
    \ what to do for combined text bubbles.\nI guess bold Cambria is good as anything\
    \ else. ;\n-----\nBrown Rabbit: Well, you repudiated my\n              offer.\
    \ Off I go now. ;\nNegligent Lop: I ... uh ... material\n               misrepresentation.\n\
    \               Bye. ;\nBoth Tort Bunny and Negligent Lop exist stage left. ;\n\
    -----\nTort Bunny looks down at the flower in her right paw. ;\nIt flops down\
    \ loosely into her left. ;\nHer ears tilt slightly to the sides. ;\nShe looks\
    \ sad, perhaps uncertain. ;\n"
