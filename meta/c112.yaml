    Brown Rabbit: Bar prep! ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Come again? ;
    Brown Rabbit: It's a mix of habanero
                  peppers, pickle juice,
                  tequila, olives, and lye. ;
    Brown Rabbit: If I can stomach this, the bar will
                  be a cakewalk by comparison. ;
    -----
    Tort Bunny: Isn't your bar exam next year? ;
