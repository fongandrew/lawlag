    <p><b><date></b>. Our legal code is exceptional -- created by the same people who make up rules like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_before_E_except_after_C">"I before E except after C unless it's weird"</a> no doubt. </p>
  transcript: |
    Question 12 ;
        Horatio and Pierre are competing lettuce
    vendors. Horatio is convinced that his lettuce is
    superior and believes that if Pierre just tastes his
    lettuce, Pierre will give up at life. Horatio offers
    to give Pierre one free head of lettuce, valued at
    $890, and Pierre accepts. Is there a contract? ;
    (A) No, Pierre did not take on any legal
        detriment as consideration. ;
    (B) No, unless Pierre actually gives up at life. ;
    (C) Yes, Pierre is giving up at life. Therefore,
        there is consideration.

    Brown Rabbit: Oh, I know this.
                  The answer is A! ;
    -----
    (A) is incorrect. Pierre is obviously French.
    Under the UCC, consideration is not required
    in contracts between merchants for goods over
    $727 when one of the merchants is French. ;
    
    Explanations for the other choies are blurred out but they read as follows. ;
    
    (D) is correct. Under the UCC, Horatio made
    an offer to Pierre, who is obviously French,
    and Pierre accepted. Because the contract
    was for goods (lettuce), between vendors
    (lettuce vendors), and over $727, consid-
    eration is not required. ;
    
    (B) is incorrect for the reasons stated in A.
    Moreover, Pierre is obviously French, and the
    French never give up, except against the British..
    And the Prussians. And during the Russian
    winter. And when trying to build a canal in
    Panama. Also, Vichy French don't count. ;
    
    (C) is incorrect. Pierre did not actually give up
    at anything. Except invading Russia during the
    winter. And the Maginot line. ;
