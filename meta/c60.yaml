    <p><b><date></b>. <a href="http://<domain>/7.html">I've referenced this before</a>, but see <a href="http://www.discourse.net/archives/2003/10/why_lawyers_fear_minks.html"><i>Foster v. Preston Mill Co.</i></a>, 268 P.2d 645 (Wash. 1954) and <a href="http://www.debmark.com/rabbits/faq/eatyoung.htm">this</a>. Under tort law, you are strictly liable for the consequences of "ultrahazardous" activities. In contrast, when engaged in less-than-ultra-hazardous activities, you are only liable if you are negligent and breach a standard of care. Modern tort law uses the term "inherently dangerous" rather than "ultrahazardous," but I think ultrahazardous sounds funnier.</p>

  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit wakes up next to a Beer-pong / Beirut table with plastic beer cups.
    Negligent Lop: I see you had a fun night. ;
    Brown Rabbit: I'm holding you liable
                  for this headache. ;
    Negligent Lop: Come again? ;
    Brown Rabbit: Strictly liable. ;
    -----
    Brown Rabbit (off-panel): Everclear and Tort Bunny
                              have two things in common. ;
    Brown Rabbit (off-panel): One, they are both 
                              ultrahazardous.  Two,
                              you brought them both
                              to last night's party. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: Tort Bunny isn't
                   ultrahazardous. ;
    Brown Rabbit: She hit me in the face. Also,
                  her name is Tort Bunny. ;
    Brown Rabbit has a black eye. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: Well, my name is Negligent Lop. ;
    Brown Rabbit: If you want to dig that hole,
                  I will gladly hand you a shovel
                  once my hangover is done
                  hitting me on the head with it. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: You know what's inherently
                   dangerous? Yo momma. ;
    Brown Rabbit: That's actually true. My
                  mother was startled by
                  an explosion when I was
                  born and instinctively
                  tried to eat me. ;
    -----
    Negligent Lop: I ... I had no idea. ;
    Brown Rabbit: No one ever does. ;
