  notes: |
    <p><b><date></b>. So for those of you who refresh to see if there's a new Tort Bunnies comic on Sunday night, I apologize for the delay. I'm sure you'll live though.</p>
    <p>1Ls, if you haven't paid your dues yet, please do so. We need it for Bluebooks and booze. Ditto for 2Ls and 3Ls, Negligent Lop notwithstanding.</p>
    <p>Apologies if I butchered the meter in this. I was writing this in a coffee shop while sitting next to a very bad rapper.</p>
  transcript: |
    Brown Rabbit, Tort Bunny, and Lucy Usagi are standing in a classroom. ;
    On the whiteboard is scribbled the following:
      Journal of Empty Lives and Letter Openers* ;
      20 years from now, when your kids ask you
      what you were doing when Tort Bunny kicked
      a senator in the balls, wouldn't you like
      to say "Bluebooking"? ;
