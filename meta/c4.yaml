    <p>I originally wanted to have Tort Bunny and Brown Rabbit engaged in a joust
    for word-play reasons but got hung up on the facial expressions of the rabbits''
    steeds. I then considered having them ride bicycles, but my rabbits do not have
    long enough legs to reach the pedals (although <a href="http://www.originalbigwheel.com/">Big
    Wheels</a> might have worked). I then tried making a sketch of Tort Bunny jousting
    on an office chair.</p>

    <p>It occurred to me, however, that not everyone would recognize the time-honored
    tradition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xll48Ir1btE">office</a> <a

    (or the closely related sport of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0G_tYd5sDU">mattress
    jousting</a>), so I went with a car plowing into a phone booth. <i>See</i> <i><a
