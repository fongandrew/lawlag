# LawLag

This repository contains code used to generate the tortbunnies.com
website from 2009 - present. The website itself is statically generated
from YAML files and Jinja templates.

For context, the code here was written at at a time when tools like Jekyll
(or Hugo or Hexo or what have you) weren't quite so popular yet. This code
is preserved here for curiosity's sake, but it isn't actively maintained
except as necessary to make minor changes to the Tort Bunnies site.
